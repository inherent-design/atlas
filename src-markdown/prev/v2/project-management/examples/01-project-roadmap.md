# Atlas Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the Atlas documentation and project management framework.

## Vision
Create a comprehensive meta-framework that integrates documentation, project management, and development processes through the Trimodal Tree methodology.

## Current Status
Alpha - Core concepts and initial implementation established

## Strategic Goals

### Q2 2025
- Complete v2 implementation with all core components
- Establish visual design system for documentation
- Create example implementations for all major concepts
- Begin integration of Perspective Fluidity concepts from Fabric

### Q3 2025
- Release v3 with integrated Perspective Fluidity concepts
- Implement Scale-Specific Documentation System
- Enhance cross-referencing and knowledge navigation
- Develop collaboration workflows and contribution guides

### Q4 2025
- Scale to additional domains beyond software development
- Create interactive documentation demonstrations
- Develop domain-specific implementation guides
- Establish community resources and feedback mechanisms

## Release Plan

### v2.1 (May 2025)
- **Theme**: Core Completion
- **Features**:
  - Complete README files in all directories
  - Implement example ADRs and roadmaps
  - Create task tracking and visualization system
  - Finalize technical writing guidelines
  - Eliminate duplicated content
  - Add visual design system and diagram templates

### v3.0 (August 2025)
- **Theme**: Perspective Fluidity Integration
- **Features**:
  - Scale-Fluid Documentation Structure
  - Multiple Perspective Views of Content
  - Enhanced Graph-Based Navigation
  - Integration of Quantum Fluctuation Principles
  - Intent-Based Documentation Organization
  - Temporal Dimension for Documentation Versioning

### v3.1 (October 2025)
- **Theme**: Domain Expansion
- **Features**:
  - Adaptation to non-software domains
  - Enhanced visualization capabilities
  - Interactive learning pathways
  - Documentation impact assessment
  - Advanced cross-referencing systems

## Technical Milestones

- [ ] Complete v2 directory structure
- [ ] Implement all missing README files
- [ ] Create documentation examples for all templates
- [ ] Establish visual design system
- [ ] Implement cross-referencing system
- [ ] Integrate project management with documentation
- [ ] Develop roadmap and planning templates
- [ ] Implement task management visualization
- [ ] Create Scale-Fluid documentation system
- [ ] Implement Graph-Based navigation
- [ ] Develop Multi-Perspective views

## Dependencies

- Integration of concepts from Fabric documentation
- Development of diagram and visualization standards
- Establishment of domain-specific terminology
- Implementation of cross-referencing system
- Creation of perspective-fluid documentation examples

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Concept complexity reducing accessibility | High | Medium | Create multiple entry points at different complexity levels |
| Lack of practical examples limiting adoption | Medium | High | Prioritize example creation for all key concepts |
| Over-abstraction reducing practical utility | High | Medium | Balance theory with concrete implementations |
| Inconsistency between v2 and v3 approaches | Medium | Low | Create clear migration paths and compatibility guides |

## Success Metrics

- Complete implementation of all v2 components
- Creation of at least 3 example implementations for each template
- Development of comprehensive visual design system
- Successful integration of Perspective Fluidity concepts in v3
- Positive feedback on documentation usability and clarity

## Feedback and Adjustments

This roadmap will be reviewed and updated monthly based on implementation progress and new insights gained during development.
