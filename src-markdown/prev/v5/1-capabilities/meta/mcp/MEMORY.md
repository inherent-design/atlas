# Memory MCP Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with a persistent memory system through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables Atlas to store, retrieve, and manage information across sessions, enhancing its capabilities for knowledge persistence and relationship tracking.

## Capabilities

- Create and manage entities in a persistent knowledge store
- Establish and track relationships between entities
- Add observations and attributes to entities over time
- Query the knowledge graph for connected information

## Integration with Atlas Framework

This module enhances Atlas's capabilities in these areas:
- Persistent knowledge storage across sessions
- Relationship mapping for knowledge graph implementation
- Temporal tracking of entity evolution
- Perspective-fluid querying of stored knowledge

## Usage Patterns

When working with persistent memory, Atlas can:
1. Apply trimodal principles to knowledge organization
2. Implement perspective transitions through relationship traversal
3. Support quantum partitioning of knowledge domains
4. Enable adaptive learning through observation accumulation

## Implementation Details

The integration is implemented through the MCP protocol, allowing Atlas to:
- Create and manage entities representing key concepts
- Establish typed relationships between entities
- Add observations to entities over time
- Query the knowledge graph using relationship patterns
