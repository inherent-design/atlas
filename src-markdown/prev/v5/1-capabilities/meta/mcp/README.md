## Unified Strategy for MCP Tool Selection

### Core Decision Framework

Select MCP tools based on this hierarchical decision process:

1. **Task Domain**: Match the primary task domain to the appropriate tool category
2. **Complexity Level**: Choose tools based on the complexity of the operation
3. **Integration Needs**: Consider how the operation fits into broader workflows
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize for performance and resource utilization

### Domain-Specific Tool Selection

### Complexity-Based Selection Pattern

1. **Simple Tasks (Single Operation)**
   - Use the most direct tool for the job
   - Example: **FETCH** for retrieving a single webpage

2. **Moderate Tasks (Multiple Operations, Same Domain)**
   - Use a single, powerful tool with multiple functions
   - Example: **PUPPETEER** for navigating through multiple pages with interaction

3. **Complex Tasks (Multiple Operations, Cross-Domain)**
   - Combine complementary tools in a workflow
   - Example: **ACTORS** → **MEMORY** → **SEQUENTIAL_THINKING** for data extraction, storage, and analysis

4. **Advanced Tasks (Orchestrated Workflows)**
   - Design workflows with parallel and sequential operations
   - Example: Multiple **ACTORS** in parallel → **MEMORY** → **FILESYSTEM** for comprehensive data collection and storage

## Tool Combination Patterns

### Sequential Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example Workflow |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Extract → Store | Retrieve information and save for later use | **FETCH**/**ACTORS** → **MEMORY**/**FILESYSTEM** |
| Extract → Analyze | Retrieve information and process immediately | **FETCH**/**ACTORS** → **SEQUENTIAL_THINKING** |
| Retrieve → Modify → Store | Get content, transform it, and save | **GITHUB** → **FILESYSTEM** → **GITHUB** |

### Parallel Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Multi-source Extraction | Collect data from multiple sources simultaneously | Multiple **ACTORS** instances in parallel |
| Concurrent Operations | Perform independent operations simultaneously | **FILESYSTEM** operations while **FETCH** retrieves data |

### Iterative Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Refine → Extract | Use initial results to refine further extraction | **FETCH** → **SEQUENTIAL_THINKING** → **ACTORS** |
| Extract → Verify → Refine | Validate results and adjust approach | **ACTORS** → **SEQUENTIAL_THINKING** → **ACTORS** (refined) |

## How to Call MCP Tools

### 1. Tool Selection Process

1. **Identify Task Domain**
   - Determine the primary category of the task
   - Match to the appropriate tool category from the decision framework

2. **Assess Complexity**
   - Evaluate the operation complexity (simple, moderate, complex, advanced)
   - Choose appropriate tool tier based on complexity

3. **Consider Integration Requirements**
   - Determine how this operation connects to other parts of the workflow
   - Identify data transformation needs between steps

4. **Select Specific Function**
   - Choose the most precise function within the selected tool
   - Review parameter requirements before implementation

### 2. Parameter Preparation

1. **Required Parameters**
   - Ensure all required parameters are properly formatted
   - Validate input values match expected formats
   - Use descriptive variable names for clarity

2. **Configuration Optimization**
   - For web tools:
     - Set appropriate rate limiting
     - Configure proper scoping (depth, breadth)
     - Set relevant filters
   - For file operations:
     - Use absolute paths
     - Verify target directories exist
   - For reasoning tools:
     - Structure thought processes appropriately
     - Provide sufficient context

### 3. Execution Patterns

1. **For Independent Operations**
   ```
   // Direct tool call for simple operations
   result = await TOOL.function(parameters)
   ```

2. **For Related Operations**
   ```
   // Batch execution for efficiency
   results = await Batch([
     { tool: TOOL1, function: func1, parameters: params1 },
     { tool: TOOL2, function: func2, parameters: params2 }
   ])
   ```

3. **For Complex Workflows**
   ```
   // Sequential processing with data transformation
   data1 = await TOOL1.function1(parameters)
   transformedData = processData(data1)
   result = await TOOL2.function2(transformedData)
   ```

4. **For Exploratory Operations**
   ```
   // Delegate complex search to Task
   results = await Task("Find all files containing pattern X and extract relevant sections")
   ```

### 4. Result Processing

1. **Extract Essential Information**
   - Focus on the most relevant data for the current context
   - Transform complex structures into simpler formats when appropriate

2. **Error Handling**
   - Check for common failures (timeouts, access denied, not found)
   - Implement graceful fallbacks
   - Consider retry strategies for transient errors

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache frequently accessed or expensive-to-compute results
   - Implement TTL (Time-To-Live) appropriate to data volatility
   - Consider memory vs. filesystem storage based on data size

4. **Result Transformation**
   - Convert between formats as needed (JSON → text, structured → narrative)
   - Summarize large result sets appropriately
   - Extract key insights from complex data

### 5. Contextual Integration

1. **Connect to User Intent**
   - Relate results directly to the original query
   - Highlight most relevant aspects first
   - Provide context for why this information matters

2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**
   - Add new information to the persistent knowledge structure
   - Create meaningful relationships between concepts
   - Update existing knowledge with new insights

3. **Multi-Perspective Presentation**
   - Present information from relevant perspectives
   - Adapt detail level to current context
   - Balance factual accuracy with useful abstraction

## Integration with Atlas Framework

The MCP integration layer demonstrates how Atlas's theoretical framework can be applied to practical, real-world tasks through:

### Trimodal Implementation

1. **Bottom-Up Perspective**
   - Precise tool operations with specific parameters
   - Detailed data extraction and manipulation
   - Concrete implementation of specific functionalities

2. **Top-Down Perspective**
   - Workflow design and orchestration
   - Information architecture planning
   - System-level patterns and designs

3. **Holistic Perspective**
   - Integration across tool boundaries
   - Contextual understanding of overall process
   - Balance of resources, capabilities, and requirements

### Knowledge Graph Application

MCP operations can be modeled in the knowledge graph:

- **Entities**: Tools, data sources, operations, results
- **Relationships**: Workflows, transformations, dependencies
- **Properties**: Parameters, timestamps, result metrics

### Adaptive Perspective Framework

MCP tool selection and usage demonstrates adaptive perspective:

- **Viewing the same problem from multiple tool contexts**
- **Transitioning between perspectives based on needs**
- **Maintaining coherence across different operational approaches**

## Future Extensions

The MCP integration layer is designed to be extensible, allowing new capabilities to be added through additional MCP servers that align with Atlas's evolving framework.
