# Sequential Thinking MCP Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with a sequential thinking framework through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables Atlas to structure complex reasoning processes into discrete steps, enhancing its capabilities for problem-solving, analysis, and decision-making.

## Capabilities

- Break down complex problems into sequential thought steps
- Track reasoning processes with explicit dependencies
- Revise earlier thoughts based on new insights
- Branch reasoning paths to explore alternatives

## Integration with Atlas Framework

This module enhances Atlas's capabilities in these areas:
- Structured problem solving using explicit reasoning steps
- Temporal tracking of thought evolution
- Perspective-fluid reasoning through branching paths
- Knowledge graph application in step-by-step analysis

## Usage Patterns

When working with complex reasoning tasks, Atlas can:
1. Apply trimodal principles across sequential thinking steps
2. Implement perspective transitions through thought revisions
3. Support quantum partitioning of reasoning components
4. Enable transparent explanation of analytical processes

## Implementation Details

The integration is implemented through the MCP protocol, allowing Atlas to:
- Create sequences of explicitly numbered thought steps
- Track dependencies between thoughts in a reasoning chain
- Revise earlier thoughts when new information emerges
- Branch reasoning paths to explore alternative approaches
- Verify conclusions through step-by-step reasoning
