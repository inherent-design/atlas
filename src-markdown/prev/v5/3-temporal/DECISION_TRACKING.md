# Decision Tracking

## Core Concept

Decision Tracking provides a systematic framework for capturing, contextualizing, and preserving the decision-making processes that shape knowledge evolution over time. Unlike simple version control that records what changed, Decision Tracking captures why changes occurred, preserving the reasoning, alternatives considered, constraints faced, and expected outcomes that drove knowledge development, enabling better future decisions through historical insight.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Decision Theory Principles

Drawing from formal decision research:

- **Decision Architecture**: Structured approach to choice representation
- **Rational Choice Theory**: Models of optimal decision processes
- **Prospect Theory**: How uncertainty and risk affect decisions
- **Option Value**: Importance of maintaining future possibilities

### Knowledge Governance

Principles from knowledge management:

- **Decision Provenance**: Tracking the origin and evolution of choices
- **Institutional Memory**: Preserving organizational decision context
- **Decision Rights**: Authority and responsibility in knowledge decisions
- **Governance Frameworks**: Structured approaches to decision oversight

## Conclusion

Decision Tracking transforms knowledge management from documenting what is known to understanding why it came to be known that way. By creating a structured approach to capturing, contextualizing, and learning from the decision processes that shape knowledge, it enables more thoughtful, consistent, and effective knowledge governance over time.

When integrated with other Atlas components like Knowledge Evolution, Versioning Framework, and History Preservation, Decision Tracking creates a comprehensive temporal framework that not only preserves knowledge states but also the intellectual journey that created them. This rich temporal context enables better understanding of existing knowledge and supports more informed decisions about how knowledge should continue to evolve.
