# Versioning Framework

## Core Concept

The Versioning Framework provides a comprehensive system for tracking, managing, and reasoning about changes in knowledge and systems over time. Building on the principles of Temporal Evolution, it formalizes how different versions of knowledge entities relate to each other, enabling precise tracking of changes while maintaining coherent evolution narratives.

## Foundational Principles

### Version Identification
- Each knowledge state has a unique identifier
- Versions maintain references to their predecessors and successors
- Relationships between versions are explicitly modeled
- Version identifiers follow consistent, meaningful conventions

### Change Tracking
- Each version transition is associated with specific changes
- Changes are categorized by type and significance
- Rationale for changes is preserved
- Metadata about change context is maintained

### Temporal Coherence
- Version history maintains logical and chronological consistency
- Causal relationships between changes are preserved
- Temporal anomalies (like retroactive changes) are handled systematically
- Multiple timelines can be reconciled when appropriate

### Version Navigation
- Clear pathways exist for moving between versions
- Different traversal strategies serve different purposes
- Version history can be viewed at varying levels of detail
- Key landmark versions are identified for easier navigation

## Versioning Models

### Linear Versioning
- Sequential progression of versions along a single timeline
- Each version has exactly one predecessor and successor (except endpoints)
- Straightforward chronological ordering
- Simple, intuitive navigation between versions

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "v2.3.5",
  created: "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
  predecessor: "v2.3.4",
  successor: "v2.3.6",
  changes: [Change1, Change2, ...],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

### Branched Versioning
- Multiple development paths diverging from common ancestors
- Versions can have multiple successors (branch points)
- Branch merges reconnect divergent paths
- Parallel timelines reflect alternative development trajectories

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "feature-x/v1.2",
  created: "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
  predecessor: "main/v2.3.4",
  successors: ["feature-x/v1.3", "feature-x/merged"],
  branch: "feature-x",
  mergedTo: [{branch: "main", version: "v2.4.0"}],
  changes: [Change1, Change2, ...],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

### Semantic Versioning
- Version identifiers convey meaning about change magnitude
- Major.Minor.Patch structure indicates change significance
- Breaking changes trigger major version increments
- Compatible enhancements increment minor versions

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "v3.0.0",
  semantic: {
    major: 3,
    minor: 0,
    patch: 0
  },
  breakingChanges: [BreakingChange1, BreakingChange2],
  changeLevel: "MAJOR",
  predecessor: "v2.5.1",
  successor: "v3.0.1",
  changes: [Change1, Change2, ...],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

### Temporal Versioning
- Versions explicitly model temporal relationships
- Multiple valid states can exist at a given timepoint
- Versions have effective time ranges
- Support for retroactive changes and amendments

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "concept-x/2023Q2",
  validFrom: "2023-04-01T00:00:00Z",
  validTo: "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z",
  predecessors: [{version: "concept-x/2023Q1", relationship: "temporal_succession"}],
  successors: [{version: "concept-x/2023Q3", relationship: "temporal_succession"}],
  retroactiveChanges: [RetroChange1, RetroChange2],
  amendments: [Amendment1, Amendment2],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

## Change Classification

### Change Types
- **Addition**: New knowledge or functionality introduced
- **Modification**: Existing elements updated or revised
- **Deprecation**: Elements marked for eventual removal
- **Removal**: Elements eliminated from the system
- **Restructuring**: Organizational changes without functional impact

### Change Magnitudes
- **Major**: Fundamental changes with significant impact
- **Moderate**: Substantial changes with limited impact scope
- **Minor**: Small enhancements or clarifications
- **Trivial**: Cosmetic or insignificant adjustments

### Change Contexts
- **Evolutionary**: Regular development along expected paths
- **Corrective**: Fixing errors or misalignments
- **Adaptive**: Responding to external changes
- **Revolutionary**: Paradigm shifts or major reorientations

### Change Relations
- **Independent**: Changes unrelated to other changes
- **Dependent**: Changes requiring prior changes
- **Conflicting**: Changes incompatible with other changes
- **Complementary**: Changes enhancing other changes
