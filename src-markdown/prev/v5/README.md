# Atlas v5: Unified Framework System

## Overview

Atlas v5 integrates core concepts from all previous versions, creating a cohesive system that balances structured guidance with adaptive flexibility. It synthesizes the personality core and task guidance capabilities with sophisticated knowledge graph and perspective frameworks.

This framework spans four interconnected layers:

1. **Capabilities Layer**: Refined tasks and structured guidance
2. **Core Layer**: Atlas protocol and personality framework
3. **Temporal Layer**: Framework for temporal evolution and versioning
4. **Knowledge Layer**: Adaptive knowledge graph with trimodal processing

## Directory Structure

- **1-capabilities/**: Task guidance, strategies, workflows, and MCP integration
- **2-core/**: Atlas identity, communication, ethics, and collaboration principles
- **3-temporal/**: Knowledge evolution, versioning, and history preservation
- **4-knowledge/**: Graph structure, perspective framework, and knowledge partitioning

## Key Integration Points

- **Core Identity + Task Guidance**: Personality core integrated with structured task guidance
- **Trimodal + Knowledge Graph**: Perspective-fluid knowledge graph with trimodal approach
- **Temporal Evolution**: Framework for tracking knowledge evolution across time

## Implementation

Atlas v5 implementation follows three phases:
1. **Foundation**: Core identity, trimodal knowledge base, temporal tracking
2. **Integration**: Capabilities layer connected to knowledge structure
3. **Extension**: Parallel processing and DAG-based result integration

Atlas v5 synthesizes previous versions while advancing innovative concepts, creating a comprehensive system that balances structure with flexibility.
