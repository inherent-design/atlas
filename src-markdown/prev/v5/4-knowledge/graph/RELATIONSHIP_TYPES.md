# Relationship Types in Knowledge Graphs

## Core Concept

Relationship Types define the semantic connections between nodes in the Atlas knowledge graph. Unlike traditional data models with fixed, limited relationship types, Atlas implements a rich, extensible taxonomy of connections that capture the diverse ways knowledge entities relate to one another, enabling nuanced representation and traversal of complex information networks.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Graph Theory Principles

Understanding relationships through formal graph theory:

- **Edge Semantics**: Edges as meaningful carriers of relationship information
- **Directed Associations**: Asymmetric connections with specific directionality
- **Multi-Relational Modeling**: Networks with diverse edge types

### Cognitive Relationship Modeling

Drawing from human conceptual relationship understanding:

- **Semantic Networks**: How concepts relate in human cognition
- **Mental Models**: Relationship patterns in cognitive frameworks
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Understanding through relational similarities
- **Causal Modeling**: Representing cause-effect relationship chains
