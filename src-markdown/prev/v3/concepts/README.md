# Atlas v3 Core Concepts

This directory contains the foundational philosophical and conceptual framework for Atlas v3. These documents define the core principles that guide the implementation of perspective-fluid, intent-based, and scale-aware documentation and knowledge management systems.

## Contents

- [PERSPECTIVE_FLUIDITY.md](./PERSPECTIVE_FLUIDITY.md) - The foundational principle that knowledge exists independent of representation and can be viewed from multiple perspectives
- [INTENT_BASED_KNOWLEDGE.md](./INTENT_BASED_KNOWLEDGE.md) - How user purpose and goals should shape information presentation and organization

## Purpose

These core concepts establish the philosophical foundation for Atlas v3, providing:

1. A coherent theoretical framework for understanding knowledge representation
2. Guiding principles for implementing perspective-fluid systems
3. Conceptual models for thinking about information across different dimensions
4. Vocabulary and terminology for discussing these advanced approaches

## How to Use These Concepts

These core concepts should be understood before exploring the more specific implementation approaches in other directories. They provide the "why" behind Atlas v3's approach to knowledge management and documentation.

When implementing systems based on Atlas v3, refer back to these concepts to ensure alignment with the foundational principles and to resolve questions about design decisions.
