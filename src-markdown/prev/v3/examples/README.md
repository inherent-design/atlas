# Atlas v3 Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating the core concepts of Atlas v3. These examples show how the principles of Perspective Fluidity, Intent-Based Knowledge, Knowledge Graphs, Scale Dimensions, and Temporal Knowledge can be applied to real-world documentation and knowledge management scenarios.

## Contents

- [PERSPECTIVE_DOCUMENTATION_EXAMPLE.md](./PERSPECTIVE_DOCUMENTATION_EXAMPLE.md) - Example showing how the same technical concept can be presented differently based on perspective, intent, and scale
- [KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_EXAMPLE.md](./KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_EXAMPLE.md) - Demonstration of representing documentation as an interconnected knowledge graph rather than isolated documents

## Purpose

These examples serve to:

1. Illustrate abstract concepts with concrete implementations
2. Demonstrate the practical value of Atlas v3 principles
3. Provide templates for creating similar documentation
4. Show how these approaches transform traditional documentation

## Implementation Notes

In a fully-implemented Atlas v3 system, these examples would be interactive, with:

- Dynamic perspective switching controls
- Interactive knowledge graph navigation
- Scale adjustment sliders
- Intent declaration interfaces
- Temporal navigation controls

For demonstration purposes, these examples show static representations of what different perspectives would look like.
