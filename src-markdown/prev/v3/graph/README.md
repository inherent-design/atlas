# Knowledge Graph Systems

This directory contains documentation on the graph-based approach to knowledge representation in Atlas v3. These documents explain how to structure, navigate, and manage information as interconnected networks rather than isolated documents or hierarchical structures.

## Contents

- [KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS.md](./KNOWLEDGE_GRAPHS.md) - Core principles of graph-based knowledge organization and navigation

## Purpose

The knowledge graph approach transforms documentation from collections of isolated documents into living networks of interconnected concepts. By representing information as nodes with typed relationships, knowledge graphs enable:

1. Richer representation of complex relationships
2. Multiple valid navigation paths through information
3. Discovery of non-obvious connections
4. Contextual adaptation of information presentation

## Integration with Atlas v3

Knowledge Graphs form the structural foundation for implementing the other Atlas v3 concepts:

- **Perspective Fluidity**: Graphs can be traversed from different entry points and viewpoints
- **Intent-Based Organization**: Relationships can be filtered and prioritized based on user intent
- **Scale Dimensions**: Graph density and focus can adapt to observation scale
- **Temporal Knowledge**: Graphs can represent evolution of concepts over time

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing knowledge graph systems:

1. Define a rich taxonomy of relationship types
2. Develop appropriate visualization techniques for different graph densities
3. Create intuitive navigation controls for graph traversal
4. Implement effective filtering mechanisms for perspective adaptation
5. Ensure graph coherence across updates and changes
