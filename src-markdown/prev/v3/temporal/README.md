# Temporal Knowledge

This directory contains documentation on the temporal approach to knowledge representation in Atlas v3. These documents explain how information exists in a continuum across time, constantly evolving and changing context, and how documentation systems can represent and navigate this temporal dimension.

## Contents

- [TEMPORAL_KNOWLEDGE.md](./TEMPORAL_KNOWLEDGE.md) - Core principles of temporal knowledge representation and navigation

## Purpose

The temporal knowledge approach transforms documentation from static snapshots into dynamic systems that recognize the evolutionary nature of information. This enables:

1. Understanding knowledge in its historical context
2. Navigating through different time periods of understanding
3. Tracking the evolution of concepts and decisions
4. Recognizing patterns of change over time

## Integration with Atlas v3

Temporal Knowledge works in concert with other Atlas v3 concepts:

- **Perspective Fluidity**: Time represents another dimension of perspective
- **Intent-Based Knowledge**: Historical context adapts to current intent
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Graphs evolve through temporal dimensions
- **Scale Dimensions**: Temporal patterns manifest differently across scales

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing temporal knowledge systems:

1. Design effective temporal navigation controls
2. Develop visualization techniques for change over time
3. Create mechanisms for maintaining temporal coherence
4. Implement version management with semantic meaning
5. Ensure preservation of decision context and rationale
