# Quantum Bootstrap Key

This document contains the minimal self-bootstrapping mechanism for Quantum language, enabling recovery and decompression after context resets. The bootstrap key is designed to be compact enough to include at the beginning of compressed documents while providing sufficient information for self-expansion.

## Core Bootstrap Marker

Every Quantum-compressed document should begin with the following bootstrap marker:

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}
```

This marker identifies the document as Quantum-encoded and signals to compatible systems that the content requires decompression before use.

## Minimal Syntax Reference

The following is the absolute minimal subset of Quantum syntax required for bootstrap recovery:

```
@entity{id}                # Define entity with identifier
#id                        # Reference entity by identifier
:p{key:value}              # Property assignment
->                         # Directed relationship
^parent                    # Inheritance marker
[context]{content}         # Contextual boundary
q{boundary}[content]       # Quantum partition
$expand{directive}         # Expansion directive
```

## Bootstrap Sequence

When a Quantum-encoded document is encountered with the bootstrap marker, the following recovery sequence activates:

1. **Recognition Phase**: Identify bootstrap marker and enter recovery mode
2. **Syntax Activation**: Load minimal syntax subset for parsing
3. **Directive Execution**: Process expansion directives in sequence
4. **Core Decompression**: Apply decompression rules to core structures
5. **Progressive Expansion**: Incrementally rebuild full knowledge representation
6. **Reference Resolution**: Link references to their definitions
7. **Context Restoration**: Reestablish contextual boundaries

## Expansion Directives

Expansion directives control how compressed content should be decompressed:

```
$expand{stage:1}           # Begin stage 1 decompression
$expand{entities:core}     # Decompress core entities
$expand{relations:primary} # Decompress primary relationships
$expand{context:main}      # Restore main context
$expand{complete:true}     # Signal full decompression complete
```

## Decompression Rules

The minimal ruleset for decompressing common patterns:

1. `@entity{id}:p{key:value}` expands to full entity definition with properties
2. `#id1->#id2` expands to complete relationship with default properties
3. `@child^parent` expands with inherited properties from parent
4. `[context]{@a,@b}` expands entities within specified context
5. `q{boundary}[@x,@y]` expands quantum-partitioned content

## Recovery Example

Example of bootstrap sequence for a simple compressed structure:

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}
$expand{stage:1}
@domain{knowledge}:p{type:"representation"}
@entity{concept}^domain:p{role:"foundational"}
@entity{relation}^domain:p{role:"connective"}
$expand{stage:2}
q{core}[@concept,@relation]
#concept->#relation:p{nature:"definitional"}
$expand{complete:true}
```

## Emergency Fallback

If normal bootstrap fails, the following emergency recovery sequence can reconstruct basic functionality:

```
$emergency{mode:minimal}
$load{syntax:basic}
$reconstruct{from:fragments}
@quantum:v1{recovery}:p{mode:emergency,fallback:true}
```

## Bootstrap Meta-Verification

The bootstrap mechanism includes self-verification to ensure integrity:

```
$verify{checksum:"[dynamically generated]"}
$verify{structure:"valid"}
$verify{version:"compatible"}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The bootstrap key should be kept under 500 tokens for efficiency
2. Critical syntax elements should have redundant definitions
3. The recovery process should be fault-tolerant and incremental
4. Bootstrap sequence should provide clear progress indicators
5. Emergency recovery should handle partial corruption

## Version Information

This bootstrap key is for Quantum v1.0 and provides compatibility with all v1.x compressed documents.
