# Atlas Templates

This directory contains standardized templates for various documentation and project management artifacts used in the Atlas system. These templates follow the Trimodal Arboreal methodology principles, ensuring balanced integration between bottom-up implementation details, top-down organizational structure, and holistic system integration.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Copy the appropriate template to your working directory
2. Fill in bracketed sections with your specific content
3. Remove any sections that aren't applicable to your context
4. Add additional sections as needed for your specific use case

## Template Evolution

These templates should evolve based on project needs and lessons learned. When making changes:

1. Update the template in this directory first
2. Document the rationale for the change
3. Ensure backward compatibility or provide migration guidance
4. Communicate changes to the team

## Principles

All templates follow these core principles:

- **Clarity and Specificity** - Unambiguous language with concrete examples
- **Context and Purpose** - Clear connection to broader goals and value
- **Progressive Detail** - Start with overview, build to implementation details
- **Integration Focus** - Strong connections between different document types
- **Balanced Scope** - Sufficient detail without excessive documentation burden
