> ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - Atlas is in active development. The framework is functional but not yet production-ready. APIs may change and documentation is evolving.

Atlas is an open source framework that empowers organizations to build advanced AI agent systems with enterprise-grade reliability. It combines sophisticated document processing with powerful orchestration capabilities to create knowledge-driven applications while maintaining control, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Knowledge-First Design**: Advanced document processing with semantic chunking, rich metadata management, and sophisticated retrieval that goes beyond basic RAG implementations
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Powerful coordination of specialized agents with structured messaging, conditional workflows, and parallel processing
- **Provider Independence**: Unified interface supporting Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama with streaming support and resource optimization
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Comprehensive error handling, detailed monitoring, and production-grade reliability features
- **LangGraph Integration**: Graph-based workflows for complex, conditional agent behaviors
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintains context across sessions using ChromaDB vector storage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Anthropic API key
- `uv` for virtual environment and package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd atlas
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment with `uv`:

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
pip install uv

# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

4. Set your Anthropic API key:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# On Windows:
# set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Usage

#### Ingesting Documentation

Before using Atlas, you need to ingest documentation:

```bash
# Ingest default documentation
uv run python main.py -m ingest

# Ingest from a specific directory
uv run python main.py -m ingest -d ./src-markdown/prev/v5
```

#### Interactive Chat

Start an interactive chat session with Atlas:

```bash
# Basic CLI mode
uv run python main.py -m cli

# With custom system prompt
uv run python main.py -m cli -s path/to/your/system_prompt.md

# Using different model providers
uv run python main.py -m cli --provider openai --model gpt-4o
uv run python main.py -m cli --provider ollama --model llama3

# Advanced controller mode with parallel processing
uv run python main.py -m controller --parallel
```

#### Single Query

Run a single query without an interactive session:

```bash
uv run python main.py -m query -q "What is the trimodal methodology in Atlas?"
```

### Development

#### Utility Scripts

Atlas includes a set of utility scripts for development, testing, and debugging, organized in the `atlas/scripts` module:

1. **Debug Utilities** (`atlas/scripts/debug/`):
   - `check_db.py` - Analyze and inspect ChromaDB database contents
   - `check_models.py` - Test available model providers and their models

2. **Testing Utilities** (`atlas/scripts/testing/`):
   - `run_tests.py` - Unified test runner for all test types
   - `test_query.py` - Run test queries with different providers
   - `test_providers.py` - Compare different model providers

These tools can be invoked either directly from their module paths or through convenience wrapper scripts in the project root.

#### Testing Architecture

Atlas follows a standardized testing approach with formal tests located in the `atlas/tests/` directory. See [Testing Documentation](docs/TESTING.md) for comprehensive details.

The testing framework includes:

1. **Unit Tests** (`atlas/tests/test_*.py`):
   - Tests for specific modules (e.g., `test_models.py`, `test_env.py`, `test_schema_message_validation.py`)
   - Uses Python's unittest framework
   - Includes mocked components to avoid external dependencies

2. **Mock Tests** (`atlas/tests/test_mock.py`) - Recommended for routine development:
   - No API key required - all external dependencies are mocked
   - Very fast execution with zero API costs
   - Suitable for continuous integration

3. **Schema Validation Tests** (`atlas/tests/test_schema_*.py`):
   - Validates schema-based validation for messages, requests, and responses
   - Ensures proper serialization and deserialization of data structures
   - Tests schema compatibility across components

4. **Integration Tests** (`atlas/tests/test_api.py`):
   - Tests full system integration with real components
   - Makes real API calls (requires API key)
   - Provides cost tracking information
   - Should be used sparingly due to API costs

All tests share standardized helper functions defined in the `atlas/tests/helpers.py` module and follow consistent patterns.

#### Examples vs. Tests

The project differentiates between formal tests and usage examples:

1. **Formal Tests** (`atlas/tests/`):
   - Structured test cases with assertions
   - Designed to verify correctness
   - Run with testing frameworks
   - Include mocking and fixtures

2. **Usage Examples** (`examples/`):
   - Demonstrate how to use the Atlas API
   - Provide starting points for implementations
   - Show best practices and patterns
   - Can be run without an API key using `SKIP_API_KEY_CHECK=true`

3. **Testing Utilities** (`atlas/scripts/testing/`):
   - Test runners and helpers
   - Tools for running specific test types
   - Utilities for test result analysis

This organization keeps the concerns separated: formal verification in `tests/`, demonstrations in `examples/`, and utilities in `scripts/testing/`.

#### Running Tests and Utilities

Use the unified test runner:

```bash
# Run the preferred mock tests (no API key required)
uv run python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests mock

# Run unit tests for a specific module
uv run python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests unit --module core

# Run API tests for a specific provider (requires API key)
uv run python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests api --provider openai --confirm

# Run multiple test types at once
uv run python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests unit mock integration

# Check available model providers and their models
uv run python check_models.py --provider all

# Inspect ChromaDB contents
uv run python check_db.py

# Test with different model providers
uv run python test_providers.py --provider ollama --model llama3
uv run python test_providers.py --provider openai --model gpt-4o -i
```

> **Important Testing Notes:**
>
> 1. Always prefer the mock tests for routine development as they provide comprehensive coverage without API costs
> 2. The API tests will make actual API calls and incur charges based on token usage
> 3. When developing new features, first create mock tests before implementing the feature
> 4. All tests automatically report API cost estimation when making real API calls

#### Cost Tracking

Atlas includes cost tracking for API calls to Anthropic. When running real tests with an API key, the system will report:
- Input tokens used and their cost
- Output tokens used and their cost
- Total API cost for the operation

This feature helps monitor usage during development and testing to avoid unexpected charges.

#### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linting
uv tool run ruff check

# Run type checking
uv tool run mypy .

# Format code
uv tool run black .
```
