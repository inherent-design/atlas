# Atlas v5.0: Advanced Knowledge Representation Framework

Atlas is a comprehensive meta-framework for knowledge representation, documentation, and adaptive guidance systems. It integrates advanced graph-based knowledge structures with perspective fluidity and quantum compression techniques to create a powerful system for representing complex information.

## Core Components

### Quantum Knowledge Representation System

The Quantum system is an LLM-optimized knowledge representation language designed for maximum semantic density with minimal token usage. It enables complex knowledge structures to be compressed without information loss.

Key features:
- Ultra-compact notation for efficient knowledge representation
- Bidirectional translation between expanded and compressed forms
- Self-bootstrapping recovery mechanisms
- Context-sensitive partitioning with adaptive boundaries
- Advanced temporal evolution tracking
- Perspective fluidity for seamless viewpoint transitions
- Multi-timeline management for parallel knowledge evolution

### Atlas Framework

Atlas v5.0 integrates multiple approaches to knowledge management through a layered architecture:

1. **Capabilities Layer**: Task guidance, problem-solving strategies, and adaptive workflows
2. **Core Layer**: Identity, collaboration patterns, communication principles, and ethical framework
3. **Temporal Layer**: Knowledge evolution, versioning, history preservation, and future projection
4. **Knowledge Layer**: Graph fundamentals, partitioning systems, perspective frameworks, and trimodal integration
