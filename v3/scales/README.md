# Scale Dimensions

This directory contains documentation on the scale-fluid approach to knowledge representation in Atlas v3. These documents explain how information exists and manifests differently at various levels of granularity and abstraction, and how documentation systems can enable fluid movement across these scales.

## Contents

- [SCALE_DIMENSIONS.md](./SCALE_DIMENSIONS.md) - Core principles of scale-fluid documentation and knowledge representation

## Purpose

The scale dimensions approach transforms documentation from fixed-scale representations into fluid systems that adapt to the appropriate level of detail and abstraction. This enables:

1. Seamless transitions between different levels of detail
2. Appropriate information density for current needs
3. Recognition of scale-specific properties and relationships
4. Consistent conceptual models across scales

## Integration with Atlas v3

Scale Dimensions work in concert with other Atlas v3 concepts:

- **Perspective Fluidity**: Scale represents one dimension of perspective
- **Intent-Based Knowledge**: Intent often determines appropriate scale
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Graph traversal enables scale navigation
- **Temporal Knowledge**: Information evolution occurs across scales

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing scale-fluid systems:

1. Develop clear indicators of current scale context
2. Create intuitive controls for scale navigation
3. Design consistent transition patterns between scales
4. Ensure information coherence across scale boundaries
5. Implement scale-appropriate visualization techniques
