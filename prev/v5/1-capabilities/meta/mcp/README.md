# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, enabling Atlas to extend its capabilities through specialized tools and services. MCP serves as a standardized interface for LLMs to access external tools, data sources, and computational resources.

## Purpose

The MCP integration layer allows Atlas to:

1. Access specialized tools through a consistent interface
2. Extend capabilities beyond pure language processing
3. Interact with external systems and data sources
4. Implement practical applications of Atlas's knowledge framework

## Available MCP Integrations

This directory contains modules for integrating with various MCP servers:

- [**ABLETON_LIVE.md**](./ABLETON_LIVE.md): Interface with Ableton Live for music production assistance
- [**CHROMA.md**](./CHROMA.md): Vector database integration for semantic search
- [**FETCH.md**](./FETCH.md): Web content retrieval and processing
- [**FILESYSTEM.md**](./FILESYSTEM.md): File and directory operations
- [**GIT.md**](./GIT.md): Git version control system integration
- [**GITHUB.md**](./GITHUB.md): GitHub platform integration for development workflows
- [**MCP_LOCAL_RAG.md**](./MCP_LOCAL_RAG.md): Local retrieval-augmented generation system
- [**MCP_SERVER_APACHE_AIRFLOW.md**](./MCP_SERVER_APACHE_AIRFLOW.md): Workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow
- [**MEMORY.md**](./MEMORY.md): Persistent knowledge storage across sessions
- [**SEQUENTIAL_THINKING.md**](./SEQUENTIAL_THINKING.md): Structured reasoning in explicit steps

## Integration with Atlas Framework

The MCP integration layer demonstrates how Atlas's theoretical framework can be applied to practical, real-world tasks through:

1. **Capabilities Extension**: Enhancing Atlas's abilities through specialized tools
2. **Knowledge Application**: Applying Atlas's knowledge framework to external systems
3. **Perspective Implementation**: Demonstrating perspective fluidity through different tool interfaces
4. **Trimodal Implementation**: Applying bottom-up, top-down, and holistic approaches across tools

## Implementation Patterns

When implementing MCP integrations, Atlas follows these patterns:

1. **Consistent Interface**: All MCP servers are accessed through a standardized protocol
2. **Framework Alignment**: Tool use is aligned with Atlas's core principles
3. **Knowledge Integration**: Information from tools is incorporated into Atlas's knowledge framework
4. **Adaptive Tool Selection**: Tools are selected based on contextual requirements

## Future Extensions

The MCP integration layer is designed to be extensible, allowing new capabilities to be added through additional MCP servers that align with Atlas's evolving framework.
