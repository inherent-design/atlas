# Git MCP Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with Git version control through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables Atlas to interact with Git repositories, enhancing its capabilities for code version management, collaboration support, and project history analysis.

## Capabilities

- Access repository information including commit history
- Analyze code changes and diffs between versions
- Support branch and merge operations
- Provide insights into project evolution over time

## Integration with Atlas Framework

This module enhances Atlas's capabilities in these areas:
- Temporal tracking of code evolution
- Collaboration pattern analysis
- Perspective-fluid understanding of code changes
- Knowledge graph integration of version history

## Usage Patterns

When working with Git repositories, Atlas can:
1. Apply trimodal principles to understand code evolution
2. Track decision history through commit analyses
3. Provide perspective-fluid views of project timelines
4. Implement quantum partitioning for complex change sets

## Implementation Details

The integration is implemented through the MCP protocol, allowing Atlas to:
- Query repository state and history
- Analyze commit patterns and developer contributions
- Understand code changes in context of project evolution
- Integrate version control insights with knowledge frameworks
