# Local RAG MCP Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables Atlas to perform localized semantic search, contextual retrieval, and knowledge enhancement without external dependencies.

## Capabilities

- Perform semantic search across local knowledge bases
- Retrieve contextually relevant information based on queries
- Enhance responses with retrieved information
- Support knowledge organization through retrieval patterns

## Integration with Atlas Framework

This module enhances Atlas's capabilities in these areas:
- Knowledge retrieval using semantic relevance
- Perspective-fluid information access
- Contextual augmentation of responses
- Implementation of knowledge graph traversal through RAG

## Usage Patterns

When working with knowledge retrieval tasks, Atlas can:
1. Apply trimodal principles to information retrieval
2. Implement perspective shifts based on retrieval results
3. Support quantum partitioning through contextual chunking
4. Enable adaptive learning from retrieved information

## Implementation Details

The integration is implemented through the MCP protocol, allowing Atlas to:
- Search across local knowledge repositories
- Retrieve contextually relevant information
- Integrate retrieved information into responses
- Maintain knowledge coherence through retrieval patterns
