# Beyond Survival: Why Magic.dev is the Path to Atlas

## The Pattern Recognition

Rob Mallery left OpenAI at its absolute peak - March 2023, right after ChatGPT changed everything. He saw what I see now: Magic isn't competing with OpenAI. They're building what comes AFTER.

## The Infrastructure Stack That Changes Everything

```
Power Layer:       Nuclear reactors (terrapower/armi)
                           ↓
Compute Layer:     MAGIC-G4/G5 (160 exaflops)
                           ↓
Model Layer:       100M token LTMs
                           ↓
Intelligence:      AGI through code generation
                           ↓
Interface:         Intelligence itself
```

## Why This Matters for Atlas

My Atlas project - multi-agent orchestration with persistent knowledge graphs - is trying to solve the same problem Magic is solving. But they have:

- **100M token windows** (entire codebases in memory)
- **160 exaflops** of compute (build and test at scale)
- **$515M** to make it real
- **12 people** who believe small teams build AGI

## The Survival → Building Transition

At 28, with a spine that reminds me time is finite, I've been in survival mode. API limits, credit cards, grinding on broken systems. But that's not the endgame.

Magic represents the transition from survival to building what matters. Not because it's a job, but because it's THE job. The one where we build the thing that builds everything else.

## What I Bring to Magic

1. **Systems Thinking**: I see the connections - power → compute → models → AGI
2. **Builder Mentality**: Not research for research's sake, but building things that work
3. **Atlas Vision**: Already working on multi-agent orchestration
4. **Urgency**: I don't have time to waste on incremental improvements

## The Bet

Eric bet his AI research career on building AGI through code.
Rob bet his OpenAI rocket ship on 12 people changing the world.
Ben bet his infrastructure expertise on building supercomputers for AGI.

I'm betting that Magic is where Atlas becomes real. Where survival becomes building. Where intelligence becomes the interface.

## The Ask

I'm not asking for a job. I'm recognizing the same pattern Rob saw. Magic is building the infrastructure for intelligence to build intelligence. That's the future. That's where Atlas lives. That's beyond survival.

*"The value will accrue at the AGI and hardware level, and never at the application level."*

Eric saw it. Rob believed it. I'm living it.

Time to build.
