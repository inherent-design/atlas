# Temporal Evolution in Knowledge Graphs

## Core Concept

Temporal Evolution represents a fundamental advancement in how temporal information is modeled within the Atlas v4 framework. Building upon v3's Temporal Knowledge principle, Temporal Evolution provides a comprehensive approach to representing, tracking, and reasoning about how knowledge and systems change over time within a directed acyclic graph structure.

## Temporal Dimension in Graphs

Traditional graphs capture a static snapshot of relationships. Temporal Evolution extends this model by:

1. **Temporal Versioning**: Every node and edge exists across a time dimension
2. **Change Tracking**: Explicit modeling of how entities and relationships evolve
3. **Historical Context**: Preservation of past states alongside current knowledge
4. **Evolution Patterns**: Recognition of common change trajectories and cycles

This creates a rich representation of knowledge and systems:

- Graph structure (representing relationships between entities)
- Temporal dimension (tracking evolution over time)
- Perspective dimension (enabling multiple viewpoints)

## Theoretical Foundation

### Temporal Graph Theory

Temporal Evolution draws from temporal graph theory, where:

- **Time-Varying Graphs**: Graphs that change structure over time
- **Temporal Reachability**: The ability to traverse from one node to another within a specified time window
- **Evolving Connectivity**: How node relationships strengthen, weaken, or transform over time
- **Temporal Patterns**: Recurring patterns of change in graph structure

### Evolutionary Systems Principles

From evolutionary systems theory, we incorporate:

- **Punctuated Equilibrium**: Systems often evolve through periods of stability interrupted by rapid change
- **Path Dependency**: Future states depend on the sequence of past states, not just the current state
- **Adaptive Landscapes**: Systems navigate through possible configurations with varying fitness
- **Convergent Evolution**: Similar patterns emerge independently in different parts of the system

## Graph Time Models

Temporal Evolution supports multiple models of time:

### Linear Time

The simplest model tracks evolution along a single timeline:

- **Version Sequence**: Ordered progression of system states
- **Causal Chain**: Each state directly influences the next
- **Historical Record**: Complete sequence of past states

### Branching Time

For systems with alternative development paths:

- **Timeline Forks**: Points where development diverges
- **Alternate Histories**: Multiple valid versions of the past
- **Potential Futures**: Speculative branches of possible evolution
- **Branch Merging**: Reconciliation of divergent development paths

### Cyclical Time

For systems with recurring patterns:

- **Seasonal Cycles**: Regular, predictable pattern repetition
- **Spiral Development**: Returning to similar concerns at higher evolution levels
- **Oscillatory Behavior**: Systems that alternate between different states
- **Phase Transitions**: Abrupt shifts between different cyclic patterns

### Relative Time

Measuring time in domain-specific units:

- **Development Epochs**: Significant periods in system evolution
- **Version Jumps**: Discrete transitions between major states
- **Evolution Velocity**: Rate of change in different system areas
- **Stability Periods**: Timeframes with minimal structural change

## Implementation Patterns

### Node Versioning

Every node in the graph exists across time:

```javascript
class TemporalNode {
  constructor(id, initialProperties, creationTime) {
    this.id = id;
    this.versions = [
      {
        properties: initialProperties,
        validFrom: creationTime,
        validTo: null,
        successor: null,
        changeReason: "Initial creation"
      }
    ];
    this.currentVersion = 0;
  }
  
  evolve(newProperties, changeTime, reason) {
    // Set end time for current version
    this.versions[this.currentVersion].validTo = changeTime;
    
    // Create new version
    const newVersion = {
      properties: {...this.versions[this.currentVersion].properties, ...newProperties},
      validFrom: changeTime,
      validTo: null,
      predecessor: this.currentVersion,
      changeReason: reason
    };
    
    // Update current version reference
    this.versions[this.currentVersion].successor = this.versions.length;
    this.versions.push(newVersion);
    this.currentVersion = this.versions.length - 1;
    
    return this;
  }
  
  // Get node state at specific time
  getVersionAt(time) {
    for (const version of this.versions) {
      if (version.validFrom <= time && 
          (version.validTo === null || version.validTo > time)) {
        return version;
      }
    }
    return null; // Node didn't exist at that time
  }
}
```

### Edge Evolution

Relationships between nodes also change over time:

```javascript
class TemporalEdge {
  constructor(sourceId, targetId, type, initialProperties, creationTime) {
    this.sourceId = sourceId;
    this.targetId = targetId;
    this.type = type;
    this.versions = [
      {
        properties: initialProperties,
        validFrom: creationTime,
        validTo: null,
        successor: null,
        changeReason: "Initial creation"
      }
    ];
    this.currentVersion = 0;
  }
  
  evolve(newProperties, changeTime, reason) {
    // Similar to node evolution
    // ...
  }
  
  // Handle relationship type changes
  changeType(newType, changeTime, reason) {
    return this.evolve({...this.versions[this.currentVersion].properties, type: newType}, 
                     changeTime, reason);
  }
  
  // Handle relationship dissolution
  dissolve(dissolveTime, reason) {
    this.versions[this.currentVersion].validTo = dissolveTime;
    this.versions[this.currentVersion].changeReason = reason;
    return this;
  }
}
```

### Temporal Graph Operations

Operations that span time dimensions:

```javascript
class TemporalGraph {
  constructor() {
    this.nodes = new Map(); // nodeId -> TemporalNode
    this.edges = new Map(); // edgeId -> TemporalEdge
    this.currentTime = Date.now();
  }
  
  // Get graph state at specific time
  getStateAt(timestamp) {
    const graphState = {
      nodes: new Map(),
      edges: new Map()
    };
    
    // Collect nodes valid at specified time
    for (const [id, node] of this.nodes.entries()) {
      const versionAtTime = node.getVersionAt(timestamp);
      if (versionAtTime) {
        graphState.nodes.set(id, {
          id,
          properties: versionAtTime.properties
        });
      }
    }
    
    // Collect edges valid at specified time
    for (const [id, edge] of this.edges.entries()) {
      const versionAtTime = edge.getVersionAt(timestamp);
      if (versionAtTime && 
          graphState.nodes.has(edge.sourceId) && 
          graphState.nodes.has(edge.targetId)) {
        graphState.edges.set(id, {
          sourceId: edge.sourceId,
          targetId: edge.targetId,
          type: edge.type,
          properties: versionAtTime.properties
        });
      }
    }
    
    return graphState;
  }
  
  // Track changes between timepoints
  getDelta(startTime, endTime) {
    return {
      addedNodes: this.getNodesAddedBetween(startTime, endTime),
      removedNodes: this.getNodesRemovedBetween(startTime, endTime),
      changedNodes: this.getNodesChangedBetween(startTime, endTime),
      addedEdges: this.getEdgesAddedBetween(startTime, endTime),
      removedEdges: this.getEdgesRemovedBetween(startTime, endTime),
      changedEdges: this.getEdgesChangedBetween(startTime, endTime)
    };
  }
  
  // Traverse the graph through time
  temporalTraversal(startNodeId, startTime, traversalStrategy) {
    // Implementation depends on traversal strategy
    // Could be forward-in-time, backward-in-time, or time-window constrained
  }
  
  // Detect evolutionary patterns
  detectPatterns(patternType, timeWindow) {
    // Implementation for detecting common evolutionary patterns
    // Such as rapid growth, oscillation, convergence, etc.
  }
}
```

### Temporal Traversal Strategies

Different approaches to navigating through time:

1. **Chronological Traversal**: Following the evolution of a specific entity over time
2. **Causal Traversal**: Following dependency chains that span time periods
3. **Delta Traversal**: Examining differences between specific time points
4. **Pattern-Based Traversal**: Finding recurring patterns of change over time
5. **Branch Exploration**: Comparing alternative evolutionary paths

## Conclusion

Temporal Evolution transforms our understanding of systems by explicitly modeling how they change over time. By preserving historical context, tracking change patterns, and enabling temporal analysis, it provides a more complete representation of knowledge and systems than static approaches.

This approach enables deeper insights into how systems develop, more accurate predictions about future states, and better decision-making about evolutionary processes. By integrating time as a first-class dimension of the knowledge graph, Atlas v4 creates a framework that truly reflects the dynamic, evolving nature of complex systems.
