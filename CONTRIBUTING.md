## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report:

1. **Check the issue tracker** to see if the problem has already been reported
2. **Try the latest version** to see if the problem has already been fixed
3. **Collect information** about the bug:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)

When creating a bug report:

1. **Use the bug report template**
2. **Use a clear and descriptive title**
3. **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
4. **Explain the behavior you expected**
5. **Include relevant details** about your configuration

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion:

1. **Use the feature request template**
2. **Use a clear and descriptive title**
3. **Provide a step-by-step description** of the suggested enhancement
4. **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
5. **List some other applications where this enhancement exists**, if applicable

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atlas? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- **Beginner issues** - issues that should only require a few lines of code and minimal testing
- **Help wanted issues** - issues that are more involved than beginner issues

### Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! This could be:

- Fixing typos or grammar errors
- Improving existing documentation
- Adding missing documentation
- Creating tutorials or examples

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

We recommend using the following tools:

- **uv** for package management
- **Visual Studio Code** with the following extensions:
  - Python
  - Pylance
  - Python Docstring Generator
  - Markdown All in One
- **pre-commit** for maintaining code quality

### Development Process

1. **Choose an issue** to work on or create a new one
2. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name
3. **Make your changes** and write tests
4. **Run the tests** locally
5. **Push your changes** to your fork
6. **Create a pull request**

### Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests.py
```

Different test types can be run with:

```bash
# Run unit tests
python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests.py --test-type unit

# Run mock tests (no API calls)
python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests.py --test-type mock

# Run integration tests (requires API keys)
python -m atlas.scripts.testing.run_tests.py --test-type integration
```

### Type Checking

Run type checking with:

```bash
mypy atlas
```

### Development Tips

- **Use feature flags** for experimental features
- **Write tests** for all new features
- **Keep changes focused** - one pull request per feature or bug fix
- **Update documentation** alongside code changes
- **Follow the style guides**

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create your pull request** from your forked repository
2. **Use the pull request template**
3. **Ensure all tests pass**
4. **Update documentation** if necessary
5. **Add your changes to the CHANGELOG** under the Unreleased section
6. **Respond to feedback** from maintainers

The PR will be merged once it:
- Passes all tests
- Follows the style guidelines
- Has at least one approval from a maintainer
- Includes appropriate documentation
- Addresses all review comments
