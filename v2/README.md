# Atlas: Trimodal Documentation and Project Framework

## Overview

Atlas is a meta-framework for designing documentation and project management systems, built on the Trimodal Tree methodology. It provides a comprehensive approach to creating, organizing, and maintaining knowledge assets throughout a project's lifecycle.

## Core Principles

Atlas is founded on four core principles:

1. **Structure Enables Creativity** - Well-designed frameworks provide the structure needed for creative freedom
2. **Integration Over Isolation** - Documentation, project management, and development should form a cohesive ecosystem
3. **Knowledge as Asset** - Documentation is a first-class product, not an afterthought
4. **Balance of Concerns** - Maintaining equilibrium between different perspectives and needs

## The Trimodal Tree Methodology

Atlas implements the Trimodal Tree methodology, which approaches problems from three complementary perspectives:

1. **Bottom-Up Implementation** - Starting with the most fundamental modules and working upward
2. **Top-Down API Design** - Designing interfaces from the top down to ensure cohesion
3. **Holistic System Integration** - Maintaining a bird's-eye view of the entire system

This trimodal approach enables a balanced development process that addresses both local optimization and global effectiveness.

- [/documentation](./documentation/) - Documentation system framework and guides
- [/methodology](./methodology/) - Detailed explanation of the Trimodal methodology
- [/project-management](./project-management/) - Project and task management frameworks
- [/assets](./assets/) - Visual design system and resources

## Implementation Status

Atlas v2 is a comprehensive implementation of the framework with:

- Complete core identity and principles documentation
- Detailed explanation of the Trimodal Tree methodology
- Structured documentation system design
- Integrated project management framework
- Task management system
- Templates and examples of key artifacts
- Visual design system for documentation

## Getting Started

For new users, we recommend starting with:

1. [ATLAS_IDENTITY.md](./core/ATLAS_IDENTITY.md) - Understanding the core principles and identity
2. [TRIMODAL_PRINCIPLES.md](./core/TRIMODAL_PRINCIPLES.md) - Learning the foundational methodology
3. [DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md](./documentation/system-design/DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md) - Exploring the documentation framework
4. [PROJECT_SYSTEM.md](./project-management/workflows/PROJECT_SYSTEM.md) - Understanding the project management approach

## Usage Examples

The framework includes practical examples of:

- [Architecture Decision Records](./documentation/examples/01-adr-example.md)
- [Project Roadmaps](./project-management/examples/01-project-roadmap.md)
- [Task Management](./project-management/tasks/TODO.md)
- [Component Diagrams](./assets/visual-system/diagram-templates/component-diagram.md)

## Contributing

Atlas is designed to evolve and improve. When contributing:

1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Adhere to the [Technical Writing Guide](./documentation/guides/TECHNICAL_WRITING.md)
3. Use the [Commit Style Guide](./project-management/templates/COMMIT_STYLE.md) for version control
4. Align new content with the Trimodal Tree methodology

## Future Development

Atlas continues to evolve with:

- Integration of Perspective Fluidity concepts
- Enhanced visual representation systems
- Expanded example implementations
- Domain-specific adaptations
- Scale-aware documentation approaches
