# Writing Guides

This directory contains guidelines for creating high-quality documentation and version control artifacts.

## Note on Content Organization

This directory is being phased out in favor of more specific locations within the project structure. The content here is now duplicated in more specific locations:

- [TECHNICAL_WRITING.md](./TECHNICAL_WRITING.md) - Now also available at `/documentation/guides/TECHNICAL_WRITING.md`
- [COMMIT_STYLE.md](./COMMIT_STYLE.md) - Now also available at `/project-management/templates/COMMIT_STYLE.md`

In future versions, this directory will be removed and all writing guides will be organized within their appropriate domains.

## Contents

- [TECHNICAL_WRITING.md](./TECHNICAL_WRITING.md) - Guide for creating high-quality technical documentation
- [COMMIT_STYLE.md](./COMMIT_STYLE.md) - Guide for writing effective commit messages
