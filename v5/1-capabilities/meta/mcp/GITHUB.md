# GitHub MCP Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with GitHub platform through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables Atlas to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and other GitHub-specific features to enhance development workflow and collaboration.

## Capabilities

- Create, read, and update GitHub repositories
- Manage issues and pull requests
- Access code and documentation on GitHub
- Support collaborative development workflows

## Integration with Atlas Framework

This module enhances Atlas's capabilities in these areas:
- Open source knowledge acquisition
- Collaborative development patterns
- Project management through GitHub workflows
- Temporal tracking of project evolution

## Usage Patterns

When working with GitHub projects, Atlas can:
1. Apply trimodal principles to repository structure analysis
2. Implement perspective-fluid approaches to issue management
3. Support knowledge graph integration with GitHub resources
4. Enable quantum partitioning of large collaborative projects

## Implementation Details

The integration is implemented through the MCP protocol, allowing Atlas to:
- Interface with GitHub's API for repository operations
- Analyze collaborative patterns in development
- Support PR reviews and issue management
- Integrate GitHub-based knowledge into Atlas's framework
