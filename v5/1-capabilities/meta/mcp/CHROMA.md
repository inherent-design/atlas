# Chroma MCP Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with Chroma vector database through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables Atlas to perform vector-based similarity search, knowledge retrieval, and semantic organization of information.

## Capabilities

- Create, manage, and modify vector collections
- Store and retrieve vector embeddings of documents and data
- Perform semantic similarity searches
- Support knowledge organization using vector representations

## Integration with Atlas Framework

This module enhances Atlas's capabilities in these areas:
- Knowledge graph implementation through vector representations
- Semantic retrieval of conceptually similar information
- Perspective-fluid search across knowledge domains
- Implementation of quantum partitioning through vector space clustering

## Usage Patterns

When working with knowledge organization and retrieval, Atlas can:
1. Store complex information in semantically searchable formats
2. Implement similarity-based knowledge connections
3. Support perspective transitions through vector space transformations
4. Enhance contextual relevance through nearest-neighbor algorithms

## Implementation Details

The integration is implemented through the MCP protocol, allowing Atlas to:
- Create and manage vector collections that represent knowledge domains
- Store document embeddings with associated metadata
- Perform similarity searches with configurable parameters
- Integrate vector-based retrieval with the broader knowledge framework
