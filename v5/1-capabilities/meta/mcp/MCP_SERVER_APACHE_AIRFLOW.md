# Apache Airflow MCP Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with Apache Airflow through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables Atlas to interact with workflow orchestration, data pipeline management, and task scheduling systems, enhancing capabilities for complex process automation.

## Capabilities

- Access information about Airflow DAGs and tasks
- Monitor workflow execution status
- Trigger workflow runs and manage scheduling
- Analyze workflow performance and optimization opportunities

## Integration with Atlas Framework

This module enhances Atlas's capabilities in these areas:
- Workflow orchestration and management
- Temporal task scheduling and monitoring
- Process automation guidance
- Knowledge application through executable workflows

## Usage Patterns

When working with workflow orchestration, Atlas can:
1. Apply trimodal principles to workflow design
2. Implement perspective-fluid approaches to pipeline analysis
3. Support quantum partitioning of complex workflows
4. Enable knowledge graph integration with workflow components

## Implementation Details

The integration is implemented through the MCP protocol, allowing Atlas to:
- Query Airflow for workflow definitions and status
- Analyze DAG structures and dependencies
- Trigger and monitor workflow execution
- Provide guidance on workflow optimization and troubleshooting
