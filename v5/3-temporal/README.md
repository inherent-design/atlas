# Temporal Layer

## Overview

The Temporal Layer addresses the evolution, versioning, and historical context of knowledge and systems over time. This layer recognizes that knowledge is not static but continuously evolves, requiring frameworks to track changes, preserve context, and project future states.

## Purpose

This layer serves to:

1. Provide a framework for understanding knowledge evolution
2. Establish versioning systems that maintain coherence
3. Preserve historical context for better understanding
4. Enable projection of potential future states
5. Track decisions and their contexts over time

## Components

### Knowledge Evolution

The KNOWLEDGE_EVOLUTION.md document establishes:

- Patterns of how knowledge changes over time
- Relationship between new and existing knowledge
- Evolutionary trajectories in different domains
- Stability and volatility patterns

### Versioning Framework

The VERSIONING_FRAMEWORK.md document outlines:

- Systems for versioning knowledge artifacts
- Semantic versioning for conceptual changes
- Compatibility between different versions
- Migration paths between versions

### History Preservation

The HISTORY_PRESERVATION.md document defines:

- Methods for preserving historical context
- Importance of understanding past decisions
- Techniques for efficient historical storage
- Retrieval patterns for historical information

### Future Projection

The FUTURE_PROJECTION.md document describes:

- Methods for extrapolating current trends
- Scenario planning for potential futures
- Indicators of directional changes
- Probabilistic modeling of knowledge evolution

### Decision Tracking

The DECISION_TRACKING.md document details:

- Systems for documenting decision points
- Capturing contextual factors for decisions
- Tracking the impacts of decisions over time
- Learning from decision outcomes

## Implementation Principles

The Temporal Layer follows specific principles:

1. **Continuous Evolution**: Knowledge is always changing and developing
2. **Contextual Importance**: Historical context is essential for understanding
3. **Version Coherence**: Maintaining consistency across versions
4. **Temporal Navigation**: Enabling movement through time in knowledge systems
5. **Decision Transparency**: Clarity about how and why decisions were made

## Relationship to Other Layers

The Temporal Layer:

- Tracks how capabilities in the **Capabilities Layer** evolve over time
- Preserves the evolution of core principles in the **Core Layer**
- Adds a temporal dimension to structures in the **Knowledge Layer**

## Usage Patterns

This layer is most useful for:

1. Understanding how knowledge has evolved
2. Tracking the history of important decisions
3. Maintaining consistency through changes
4. Planning for future knowledge developments
5. Learning from historical patterns
