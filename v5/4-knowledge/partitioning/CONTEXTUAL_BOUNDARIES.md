# Contextual Boundaries

## Core Concept

Contextual Boundaries revolutionizes how we define and manage system boundaries by recognizing that the most effective partitioning of complex systems depends on context, purpose, and perspective. Building upon Quantum Partitioning's foundation, Contextual Boundaries specifically focuses on how boundaries emerge, adapt, and function based on changing contextual factors.
