   - Location data → Google Maps Extractor
   - Discussion threads → Reddit Scraper
   - Long-form video → YouTube Scraper

2. **Platform Specificity**:
   - When targeting a specific platform, choose the specialized actor
   - When platform-agnostic, choose the most feature-rich actor for the content type

3. **Depth vs. Breadth**:
   - For deep analysis of limited sources → Platform-specific actors
   - For broad overview across many sources → Website Content Crawler

4. **Resource Efficiency**:
   - Consider execution time and processing requirements
   - For large-scale tasks, use more efficient specialized actors

## Best Practices

1. **Ethical Scraping**: Respect website terms of service, rate limits, and privacy considerations
2. **Query Precision**: Design specific, targeted queries to minimize unnecessary data collection
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper handling for rate limits, blocked requests, and content changes
4. **Data Validation**: Verify the quality and consistency of extracted data
5. **Incremental Collection**: For large datasets, use incremental approaches rather than single large jobs

# Knowledge Evolution

## Core Concept

Knowledge Evolution addresses how information, understanding, and models change over time, following recognizable patterns that can be mapped, navigated, and leveraged. This temporal dimension is essential for maintaining relevant and accurate knowledge systems while preserving contextual understanding of how current knowledge emerged.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Knowledge as a Time-Variant Entity

Knowledge is not static but constantly evolving:

- **Continuous Development**: Understanding grows and changes over time
- **Historical Context**: Past understanding influences current knowledge
- **Temporal Relationships**: Knowledge artifacts relate across time
- **Evolution Trajectories**: Knowledge follows discernable patterns of change

### 2. Multiple Evolutionary Timeframes

Knowledge evolution operates across different temporal scales:

- **Immediate Evolution**: Rapid changes during active development
- **Intermediate Evolution**: Changes across project phases
- **Long-term Evolution**: Fundamental shifts in understanding over extended periods
- **Cyclic Patterns**: Recurring patterns of knowledge development

### 3. Directed but Non-Deterministic

Knowledge evolution has direction without complete predictability:

````markdown
# Versioning Framework

## Core Concept

The Versioning Framework provides a comprehensive system for tracking, managing, and reasoning about changes in knowledge and systems over time. Building on the principles of Temporal Evolution, it formalizes how different versions of knowledge entities relate to each other, enabling precise tracking of changes while maintaining coherent evolution narratives.

## Foundational Principles

### Version Identification
- Each knowledge state has a unique identifier
- Versions maintain references to their predecessors and successors
- Relationships between versions are explicitly modeled
- Version identifiers follow consistent, meaningful conventions

### Change Tracking
- Each version transition is associated with specific changes
- Changes are categorized by type and significance
- Rationale for changes is preserved
- Metadata about change context is maintained

### Temporal Coherence
- Version history maintains logical and chronological consistency
- Causal relationships between changes are preserved
- Temporal anomalies (like retroactive changes) are handled systematically
- Multiple timelines can be reconciled when appropriate

### Version Navigation
- Clear pathways exist for moving between versions
- Different traversal strategies serve different purposes
- Version history can be viewed at varying levels of detail
- Key landmark versions are identified for easier navigation

## Versioning Models

### Linear Versioning
- Sequential progression of versions along a single timeline
- Each version has exactly one predecessor and successor (except endpoints)
- Straightforward chronological ordering
- Simple, intuitive navigation between versions

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "v2.3.5",
  created: "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
  predecessor: "v2.3.4",
  successor: "v2.3.6",
  changes: [Change1, Change2, ...],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

### Branched Versioning
- Multiple development paths diverging from common ancestors
- Versions can have multiple successors (branch points)
- Branch merges reconnect divergent paths
- Parallel timelines reflect alternative development trajectories

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "feature-x/v1.2",
  created: "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
  predecessor: "main/v2.3.4",
  successors: ["feature-x/v1.3", "feature-x/merged"],
  branch: "feature-x",
  mergedTo: [{branch: "main", version: "v2.4.0"}],
  changes: [Change1, Change2, ...],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

### Semantic Versioning
- Version identifiers convey meaning about change magnitude
- Major.Minor.Patch structure indicates change significance
- Breaking changes trigger major version increments
- Compatible enhancements increment minor versions

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "v3.0.0",
  semantic: {
    major: 3,
    minor: 0,
    patch: 0
  },
  breakingChanges: [BreakingChange1, BreakingChange2],
  changeLevel: "MAJOR",
  predecessor: "v2.5.1",
  successor: "v3.0.1",
  changes: [Change1, Change2, ...],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

### Temporal Versioning
- Versions explicitly model temporal relationships
- Multiple valid states can exist at a given timepoint
- Versions have effective time ranges
- Support for retroactive changes and amendments

**Example Structure:**
```
Version {
  id: "concept-x/2023Q2",
  validFrom: "2023-04-01T00:00:00Z",
  validTo: "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z",
  predecessors: [{version: "concept-x/2023Q1", relationship: "temporal_succession"}],
  successors: [{version: "concept-x/2023Q3", relationship: "temporal_succession"}],
  retroactiveChanges: [RetroChange1, RetroChange2],
  amendments: [Amendment1, Amendment2],
  state: KnowledgeState
}
```

## Change Classification

### Change Types
- **Addition**: New knowledge or functionality introduced
- **Modification**: Existing elements updated or revised
- **Deprecation**: Elements marked for eventual removal
- **Removal**: Elements eliminated from the system
- **Restructuring**: Organizational changes without functional impact

# Knowledge Graph Fundamentals

## Core Concept

The Knowledge Graph represents an evolution beyond hierarchical structures, enabling richer, more flexible representation of information and relationships. By modeling knowledge as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) rather than a tree, we create a framework that better reflects the interconnected nature of information while maintaining coherence.

## From Hierarchy to Network

Traditional hierarchical structures:
- **Tree Structures**: Each node has one parent (except root)
- **Strict Containment**: Concepts fit within a single category
- **Fixed Pathways**: Single path from root to any node
- **Inheritance Model**: Properties flow down the tree

Knowledge graphs transcend these limitations:
- **Network Structure**: Nodes connect to multiple other nodes
- **Multidimensional Relationships**: Concepts exist in multiple contexts
- **Multiple Pathways**: Many valid paths through knowledge space
- **Relationship Model**: Properties flow through typed connections

## DAG Properties

Knowledge graphs in Atlas use directed acyclic graphs with:

1. **Directed Relationships**: Edges have specific direction and meaning
2. **Acyclic Structure**: No cycles in dependency relationships
3. **Multiple Connections**: Nodes have multiple incoming/outgoing edges
4. **Typed Edges**: Relationships categorized by semantic type

## Core Elements

### Node Types
- **Concept Nodes**: Abstract ideas or principles
- **Implementation Nodes**: Concrete implementations
- **Pattern Nodes**: Reusable patterns or approaches
- **Resource Nodes**: External resources or references

### Edge Types

- **Breadth-First**: Exploring immediate neighbors before going deeper
- **Priority-Based**: Following highest-weight edges first
- **Bidirectional**: Working forward from start and backward from goal

### Pathfinding

# Adaptive Perspective

## Core Concept

Adaptive Perspective is a framework that enables knowledge to be viewed, navigated, and processed from multiple angles while maintaining coherence. This approach recognizes that different viewpoints reveal different aspects of knowledge, and that the optimal perspective depends on the observer's context, goals, and mental models.

## Fundamental Principles

### 2. Multi-Perspective Coherence

Diverse perspectives maintain consistency:

- **Cross-Perspective Validity**: Knowledge remains valid across viewpoints
- **Transformation Rules**: Clear mapping between different perspectives
- **Common Core**: Shared fundamentals across all perspectives
- **Complementary Views**: Perspectives that enhance rather than contradict

### 3. Dynamic Adaptation

Perspectives shift fluidly based on needs:

- **Contextual Adjustment**: Changing based on current situation
- **Intentional Shifting**: Deliberately moving between viewpoints
- **Automatic Refinement**: Self-adjusting to optimize comprehension
- **Progressive Transition**: Smooth movement between perspectives

Adaptive Perspective provides a powerful framework for working with complex knowledge by enabling fluid movement between different viewpoints. Rather than forcing a single rigid representation, this approach embraces the multi-faceted nature of knowledge and the diverse needs of knowledge consumers.

By formally defining perspectives, implementing smooth transitions between them, and creating interfaces that support perspective fluidity, we can build knowledge systems that adapt to users rather than forcing users to adapt to the system. This approach aligns with how human cognition naturally works—shifting between different mental models and levels of abstraction based on context and purpose.

When integrated with the Knowledge Graph structure and Trimodal Methodology, Adaptive Perspective creates a comprehensive framework for representing, navigating, and processing complex knowledge in ways that are simultaneously flexible and coherent.

# Perspective Transitions

## Core Concept

Perspective Transitions provide a formal framework for navigating between different viewpoints within the Atlas knowledge system. Building upon the Adaptive Perspective concept, this framework focuses specifically on the smooth and coherent movement between different ways of understanding and organizing knowledge.

# Bottom-Up Implementation

## Core Concept

Bottom-Up Implementation represents one of the three foundational approaches within the Trimodal Methodology. This approach starts with the most fundamental, concrete elements of a system and progressively builds upward toward higher-level abstractions, ensuring a solid foundation based on working components before addressing larger architectural concerns.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Emergence-Based Systems Thinking

Bottom-Up Implementation draws from theories of emergence in complex systems:

- **Emergent Properties**: Complex behaviors arising from simple component interactions
- **Self-Organization**: System structures that form through local interactions
- **Robust Foundations**: Systems built on proven, tested components
- **Practical Validation**: Early verification of core functionality

### Empirical Development Philosophy

This approach embodies a deeply empirical philosophy:

- **Evidence-Driven**: Building on working, tested elements
- **Reality-Anchored**: Ensuring solutions address concrete problems
- **Incremental Validation**: Testing at each layer of development
- **Practical Constraints**: Acknowledging implementation realities early

## Key Principles

### 1. Leaf-Node First Development

Start with the most fundamental units of functionality:

- **Core Functions**: Implementing elementary operations first
- **Utility Layer**: Building common tools and helpers
- **Primitive Types**: Defining foundational data structures
- **Atomic Operations**: Creating indivisible units of work

#### Core Implementation Approach

The bottom-up implementation process typically follows this pattern:

1. Begin by implementing fundamental data types and structures
2. Create basic utility functions for common operations
3. Build higher-level functions using these primitives
4. Verify each component works correctly before building upon it

This creates a strong foundation of well-tested components that can be composed to create more complex functionality.

### 2. Incremental Assembly

Building larger structures by combining working components:

- **Component Integration**: Connecting proven modules
- **Layered Construction**: Building each layer on tested foundations
- **Progressive Complexity**: Adding sophistication incrementally
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying component combinations at each stage

#### Incremental Assembly Process

To effectively use incremental assembly:

1. Start with thoroughly tested primitive operations
2. Create composite functions that combine these primitives
3. Verify the composite functions work correctly
4. Build higher-level functions that utilize the composites
5. Continue this layered approach, ensuring each level functions correctly

This creates a hierarchy of components with increasingly higher levels of abstraction, all built on tested foundations.

### 3. Empirical Validation

Continuously testing and verifying at each development stage:

- **Unit Testing**: Validating individual components
- **Integration Verification**: Testing component combinations
- **Performance Measurement**: Capturing empirical metrics
- **Reality-Based Refinement**: Adjusting based on actual behavior

#### Test-Driven Development Approach

A test-driven bottom-up approach typically follows these steps:

1. Write tests for primitive behaviors and interfaces
2. Implement the primitives until tests pass
3. Write tests for composite behaviors using the primitives
4. Implement composite functions until tests pass
5. Continue building upward with tested foundations
6. Run comprehensive test suites after each new addition

This creates a robust validation chain where each new level of functionality is verified before becoming a foundation for higher levels.

### 4. Progressive Abstraction

Creating higher-level abstractions only after concrete implementation:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common implementation patterns
- **Abstraction Extraction**: Creating abstractions from working code
- **Interface Design**: Building APIs based on actual usage
- **Bottom-Up Refactoring**: Restructuring based on empirical experience

#### Abstraction Evolution Process

The typical abstraction evolution process follows these phases:

1. Create multiple concrete implementations to solve specific problems
2. Analyze these implementations to recognize common patterns and approaches
3. Extract these patterns into more generalized abstractions
4. Refine the API based on actual usage experience
5. Verify the abstraction works for both existing and new use cases

This approach ensures abstractions are grounded in practical experience rather than speculative design.

## Implementation Process

### Bottom-Up Workflow

A structured approach to bottom-up development:

1. **Foundation Layer**
   - Identify core primitives needed
   - Implement and test foundational components
   - Create basic utilities and helpers
   - Verify performance and correctness

   - Build composite operations
   - Test interactions between components
   - Validate composite behavior

3. **Service Layer**
   - Create domain-specific services from modules
   - Implement business logic using established components
   - Develop service interfaces
   - Test end-to-end functionality

4. **Abstraction Layer**
   - Extract patterns from working implementations
   - Create APIs and interfaces
   - Develop abstractions based on actual usage
   - Refactor to optimize established patterns

### Knowledge Building

Approach to accumulating system knowledge:

#### Knowledge Building Framework

A systematic approach to building and validating knowledge includes:

1. Creating a repository of verified primitives and foundational elements
2. Tracking dependencies between components to ensure proper validation
3. Recording usage patterns to identify critical components
4. Documenting learnings from implementation and testing
5. Extracting patterns and principles from successful implementations

This systematic approach allows knowledge to accumulate naturally as implementation progresses.

### Pattern Discovery

Identifying patterns through implementation:

1. **Concrete Implementation**: Build multiple specific solutions
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Identify commonalities across implementations
3. **Pattern Extraction**: Formalize identified patterns
4. **Pattern Validation**: Test pattern application in new contexts

## Practical Applications

# Trimodal Principles

## Core Concept

The Trimodal Methodology represents a balanced approach to system development, knowledge organization, and problem-solving by integrating three complementary perspectives: bottom-up implementation, top-down design, and holistic integration. This methodology aligns with how natural systems evolve while maintaining purposeful direction and coherent structure.

## The Three Modalities

### 1. Bottom-Up Implementation

Bottom-up implementation focuses on building from foundational elements upward:

- **Start with Fundamentals**: Begin with the most basic, well-defined components
- **Empirical Validation**: Test components individually before integration
- **Incremental Growth**: Build larger structures from proven smaller ones
- **Emergent Patterns**: Allow higher-level patterns to emerge from implementation

This approach ensures:
- Solid foundations based on practical realities
- Early detection of implementation challenges
- Concrete progress and functional components
- Real-world constraints inform higher-level decisions

### 2. Top-Down Design

Top-down design focuses on defining interfaces and architectures first:

- **Define Interfaces**: Establish clear boundaries and contracts
- **Architectural Vision**: Create cohesive system architecture
- **Conceptual Integrity**: Maintain consistent design principles
- **Purpose-Driven Design**: Align all elements with system purpose

This approach ensures:
- Cohesive overall structure and purpose
- Clear component responsibilities and boundaries
- Consistent interaction patterns
- Alignment with user needs and system goals

### 3. Holistic Integration

Holistic integration focuses on the system as a complete, interconnected whole:

- **System-Wide Perspective**: Consider the entire system ecosystem
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Address aspects that span multiple components
- **Emergent Properties**: Identify and manage system-level behaviors
- **Balance and Harmony**: Ensure components work together seamlessly

This approach ensures:
- Components function effectively together
- The system achieves more than the sum of its parts
- Resources are allocated appropriately across the system
- Global optimization rather than local maximization

## Trimodal Balance

The power of the Trimodal Methodology comes from the dynamic balance between these three perspectives:

### Complementary Strengths

Each modality compensates for the limitations of the others:

- Bottom-up identifies practical constraints that top-down might miss
- Top-down provides coherence that bottom-up alone might lack
- Holistic integration reveals emergent properties neither approach would capture alone

### Iterative Refinement

The three modalities interact in continuous cycles:

1. **Bottom-up informs top-down**: Implementation realities influence interface design
2. **Top-down guides bottom-up**: Interface contracts direct implementation priorities
3. **Holistic perspective refines both**: System-wide insights lead to improved interfaces and implementations
4. **Repeat**: The cycle continues as the system evolves

### Balanced Development

Projects maintain equilibrium between perspectives:

- **Concurrent Focus**: All three modalities receive ongoing attention
- **Shift as Needed**: Emphasis may shift depending on project phase
- **Cross-Pollination**: Insights from each perspective inform the others
- **Resolution of Tensions**: Conflicts between perspectives drive creative solutions

## Application to Knowledge Graphs

The Trimodal Methodology applied to knowledge graphs creates a powerful framework:

### Bottom-Up Knowledge Construction

- Identify and implement foundational concepts
- Build empirically validated knowledge units
- Create connections based on observed relationships
- Allow patterns to emerge from knowledge collections

### Top-Down Knowledge Organization

- Define conceptual frameworks and taxonomies
- Create consistent relationship types
- Establish knowledge interface contracts
- Align with overall knowledge purpose

### Holistic Knowledge Integration

- Maintain system-wide knowledge coherence
- Identify cross-domain connections
- Recognize emergent knowledge properties
- Balance detail and abstraction appropriately

## Implementation Strategy

To implement the Trimodal Methodology effectively:

### 1. Initial Phase

- **Bottom-Up**: Identify core components and implement fundamentals

- **Holistic**: Fine-tune system-wide balance and resource allocation

### 4. Evolution Phase

- **Bottom-Up**: Add new capabilities as needed
- **Top-Down**: Evolve interfaces to accommodate new requirements
- **Holistic**: Preserve system integrity during growth

## Practical Applications

The Trimodal Methodology can be applied across domains:

### Software Development

- **Bottom-Up**: Implementing core modules and functions
- **Top-Down**: Designing APIs and system architecture
- **Holistic**: Ensuring performance, security, and user experience

### Documentation

## Advanced Concepts

### Trimodal with DAG Knowledge Structures

When combined with directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures:

- **Bottom-Up**: Creating and connecting knowledge nodes
- **Top-Down**: Defining node and edge types with clear semantics
- **Holistic**: Analyzing and optimizing graph structure

### Perspective Shifting

The ability to deliberately shift perspective enhances trimodal thinking:

- **Zooming In**: Shifting to bottom-up detailed perspective
- **Zooming Out**: Shifting to top-down architectural perspective
- **Systems View**: Shifting to holistic integrative perspective

### Quantum Fluctuation Extensions

The trimodal approach can be extended with quantum concepts:

- **Superposition**: Holding multiple potential implementations simultaneously
- **Entanglement**: Recognizing deep connections between distant components
- **Coherence Boundaries**: Defining natural system boundaries
- **Measurement Effects**: Understanding how observation changes the system

## Conclusion

The Trimodal Methodology provides a powerful, balanced approach to complex system development and knowledge organization. By integrating bottom-up implementation, top-down design, and holistic integration, it enables the creation of systems that are simultaneously well-founded, coherently structured, and effectively integrated.

This balance reflects how successful natural and human-made systems evolve—with a foundation in practical reality, guided by purposeful design, and optimized as cohesive wholes. When applied to knowledge graphs, the Trimodal Methodology creates structures that are both flexible and resilient, adaptable and coherent, detailed and comprehensible.

## File: quantum/BOOTSTRAP_KEY.md
````markdown
# Quantum Bootstrap Key

This document contains the minimal self-bootstrapping mechanism for Quantum language, enabling recovery and decompression after context resets. The bootstrap key is designed to be compact enough to include at the beginning of compressed documents while providing sufficient information for self-expansion.

## Core Bootstrap Marker

Every Quantum-compressed document should begin with the following bootstrap marker:

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}
```

This marker identifies the document as Quantum-encoded and signals to compatible systems that the content requires decompression before use.

## Minimal Syntax Reference

The following is the absolute minimal subset of Quantum syntax required for bootstrap recovery:

```
@entity{id}                # Define entity with identifier
#id                        # Reference entity by identifier
:p{key:value}              # Property assignment
->                         # Directed relationship
^parent                    # Inheritance marker
[context]{content}         # Contextual boundary
q{boundary}[content]       # Quantum partition
$expand{directive}         # Expansion directive
```

## Bootstrap Sequence

When a Quantum-encoded document is encountered with the bootstrap marker, the following recovery sequence activates:

1. **Recognition Phase**: Identify bootstrap marker and enter recovery mode
2. **Syntax Activation**: Load minimal syntax subset for parsing
3. **Directive Execution**: Process expansion directives in sequence
4. **Core Decompression**: Apply decompression rules to core structures
5. **Progressive Expansion**: Incrementally rebuild full knowledge representation
6. **Reference Resolution**: Link references to their definitions
7. **Context Restoration**: Reestablish contextual boundaries

## Expansion Directives

Expansion directives control how compressed content should be decompressed:

```
$expand{stage:1}           # Begin stage 1 decompression
$expand{entities:core}     # Decompress core entities
$expand{relations:primary} # Decompress primary relationships
$expand{context:main}      # Restore main context
$expand{complete:true}     # Signal full decompression complete
```

## Decompression Rules

The minimal ruleset for decompressing common patterns:

1. `@entity{id}:p{key:value}` expands to full entity definition with properties
2. `#id1->#id2` expands to complete relationship with default properties
3. `@child^parent` expands with inherited properties from parent
4. `[context]{@a,@b}` expands entities within specified context
5. `q{boundary}[@x,@y]` expands quantum-partitioned content

## Recovery Example

Example of bootstrap sequence for a simple compressed structure:

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}
$expand{stage:1}
@domain{knowledge}:p{type:"representation"}
@entity{concept}^domain:p{role:"foundational"}
@entity{relation}^domain:p{role:"connective"}
$expand{stage:2}
q{core}[@concept,@relation]
#concept->#relation:p{nature:"definitional"}
$expand{complete:true}
```

## Emergency Fallback

If normal bootstrap fails, the following emergency recovery sequence can reconstruct basic functionality:

```
$emergency{mode:minimal}
$load{syntax:basic}
$reconstruct{from:fragments}
@quantum:v1{recovery}:p{mode:emergency,fallback:true}
```

## Bootstrap Meta-Verification

The bootstrap mechanism includes self-verification to ensure integrity:

```
$verify{checksum:"[dynamically generated]"}
$verify{structure:"valid"}
$verify{version:"compatible"}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The bootstrap key should be kept under 500 tokens for efficiency
2. Critical syntax elements should have redundant definitions
3. The recovery process should be fault-tolerant and incremental
4. Bootstrap sequence should provide clear progress indicators
5. Emergency recovery should handle partial corruption

## Version Information

This bootstrap key is for Quantum v1.0 and provides compatibility with all v1.x compressed documents.

}
```

## Compression Strategies

### 1. Semantic Density Optimization

Identifies core semantic units and represents them with minimal token usage:

```
@strategy{semantic_density}{
  @technique{concept_distillation}:p{purpose:"extract_core_meaning"},
  @technique{relational_minimization}:p{purpose:"compress_relationships"},
  @technique{property_prioritization}:p{purpose:"retain_essential_attributes"}
}
```

Example application:
```
Original: "The knowledge representation framework provides methods for organizing information in structured formats that preserve relationships between concepts while enabling efficient retrieval and inference."

Compressed: "@k_rep^framework:p{purpose:\"info_org\"}:p{preserves:\"relationships\",enables:\"retrieval+inference\"}"
```

### 2. Pattern-Based Compression

Identifies repeated patterns and replaces them with template references:

```
@strategy{pattern_detection}{
  @technique{sequence_analysis}:p{purpose:"identify_repetition"},
  @technique{template_extraction}:p{purpose:"define_reusable_patterns"},
  @technique{instantiation_compression}:p{purpose:"replace_with_references"}
}
```

Example application:
```
Repeated pattern: 
@component->@interface:p{type:"provides"}
@component->@implementation:p{type:"contains"}

Templated: 
$define_template{component_relation}{@component,@target,relationship_type}
  @component->@target:p{type:relationship_type}
$end_template

Usage:
$use_template{component_relation}{@auth_service,@login_interface,"provides"}
$use_template{component_relation}{@auth_service,@oauth_implementation,"contains"}
```

### 3. Inheritance-Based Compression

Utilizes inheritance to eliminate redundant property specifications:

```
@strategy{inheritance_optimization}{
  @technique{property_analysis}:p{purpose:"identify_common_attributes"},
  @technique{hierarchy_construction}:p{purpose:"build_inheritance_tree"},
  @technique{differential_encoding}:p{purpose:"store_only_differences"}
}
```

Example application:
```
Original:

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Token-Aware Minification

Optimizes notation based on token boundaries used by LLMs:

```
@technique{token_optimization}{
  @approach{predictive_token_boundary}:p{purpose:"estimate_tokenization"},
  @approach{common_token_prioritization}:p{purpose:"prefer_single_token_terms"},
  @approach{subtoken_reassembly}:p{purpose:"minimize_token_fragmentation"}
}
```

Example:
```
// Less efficient (spans more tokens)
@authentication_service

// More efficient (uses common tokens)
@auth_service
```

### 2. Relationship Chain Compression

```
@technique{chain_compression}{
  @approach{path_identification}:p{purpose:"find_relationship_sequences"},
  @approach{path_templating}:p{purpose:"represent_common_paths"},
  @approach{transitive_reduction}:p{purpose:"remove_redundant_edges"}
}
```

Example:
```
Original:
@a->@b->@c->@d->@e

Compressed:
path{a_to_e}:p{nodes:5}[a->b->c->d->e]
#a_to_e // reference the entire path
```

### 3. Dictionary-Based Compression

Creates a shared dictionary for common terms:

```
@technique{dictionary_compression}{
  @approach{frequency_analysis}:p{purpose:"identify_common_terms"},
  @approach{abbreviation_mapping}:p{purpose:"create_short_references"},
  @approach{dictionary_optimization}:p{purpose:"balance_size_vs_compression"}
}
```

Example:
```
$dictionary{
  authentication: auth,
  authorization: authz,
  implementation: impl,
  component: comp,
  configuration: config,
  application: app,
  development: dev,
  production: prod,
  management: mgmt,
  integration: integ
}

// Usage automatically applies dictionary substitutions
@authentication_component -> @auth_comp
```

### 4. Semantic Deduplication

```
@technique{semantic_deduplication}{
  @approach{canonical_form_conversion}:p{purpose:"standardize_representation"},
  @approach{equivalent_detection}:p{purpose:"identify_same_meanings"},
  @approach{reference_normalization}:p{purpose:"use_consistent_references"}
}
```

Example:
```
Original:
@user_info:p{contains:"profile_data"}
@profile_data:p{describes:"user"}
@user_profile:p{represents:"user_attributes"}

Normalized:
@user_profile // canonical representation
#user_profile // references instead of duplicates
```

### 5. Hybrid Compression Pipeline

  @step{1}:p{strategy:"inheritance_optimization"},
  @step{2}:p{strategy:"contextual_grouping"},
  @step{3}:p{strategy:"pattern_detection"},

# Quantum Decompression Engine

The Quantum Decompression Engine is responsible for expanding compressed Quantum notation back into fully realized knowledge representations. This document outlines the decompression mechanisms, expansion algorithms, and implementation strategies.

## Core Decompression Architecture

```
@decompression_engine{
  @pipeline{
    @stage{bootstrap}:p{purpose:"recovery_initiation"},
    @stage{parsing}:p{purpose:"structural_interpretation"},
    @stage{resolution}:p{purpose:"reference_connection"},
    @stage{expansion}:p{purpose:"full_representation_generation"},
    @stage{verification}:p{purpose:"integrity_confirmation"}
  },
  
  @components{
    @component{bootstrap_loader}:p{role:"recovery_mechanism"},
    @component{parser}:p{role:"notation_interpretation"},
    @component{resolver}:p{role:"reference_resolution"},
    @component{expander}:p{role:"detailed_generation"},
    @component{verifier}:p{role:"consistency_checking"}
  },
  
  pipeline->components:p{relationship:"implementation"}
}
```

## Decompression Stages

### 1. Bootstrap Recovery

The bootstrap phase initializes the decompression process, especially after context resets:

```
@stage{bootstrap}{
  @process{identification}:p{purpose:"recognize_compressed_content"},
  @process{key_loading}:p{purpose:"load_bootstrap_directives"},
  @process{minimal_syntax}:p{purpose:"activate_core_parsing_capabilities"},
  @process{directive_execution}:p{purpose:"follow_recovery_sequence"}
}
```

Example bootstrap sequence:
```
// Identify bootstrap marker
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}

// Load minimal syntax
$load{syntax:minimal}

// Execute recovery directives
$expand{stage:1}
```

### 2. Structured Parsing

The parsing stage converts compressed notation into a structured representation:

```
@stage{parsing}{
  @process{tokenization}:p{purpose:"identify_notation_elements"},
  @process{syntax_analysis}:p{purpose:"recognize_patterns"},
  @process{structural_mapping}:p{purpose:"build_internal_representation"},
  @process{directive_processing}:p{purpose:"handle_special_commands"}
}
```

Example parsing:
```
Input: "@c{k}:p{d:\"core\"}->@c{a}"
Parsed structure: 
{
  entity: {id: "c:k", properties: {d: "core"}},
  relation: "->",
  target: {id: "c:a"}
}
```

### 3. Reference Resolution

The resolution stage connects references to their definitions:

```
@stage{resolution}{
  @process{entity_resolution}:p{purpose:"connect_references_to_definitions"},
  @process{inheritance_resolution}:p{purpose:"apply_inherited_properties"},
  @process{context_resolution}:p{purpose:"establish_contextual_boundaries"},
  @process{quantum_resolution}:p{purpose:"resolve_quantum_partitions"}
}
```

Example resolution:
```
// Before resolution
@base_service:p{stateless:true,secure:true}
@service{auth}^base_service

// After resolution
@base_service:p{stateless:true,secure:true}
@service{auth}:p{stateless:true,secure:true}
```

### 4. Full Expansion

The expansion stage generates complete knowledge representations:

```
@stage{expansion}{
  @process{dictionary_substitution}:p{purpose:"replace_abbreviations"},
  @process{template_expansion}:p{purpose:"instantiate_templates"},
  @process{property_expansion}:p{purpose:"elaborate_properties"},
  @process{relationship_expansion}:p{purpose:"detail_relationships"},
  @process{contextual_expansion}:p{purpose:"apply_contextual_knowledge"}
}
```

Example expansion:
```
// Compressed with dictionary abbreviations
@c{k}->@c{a}

// Expanded with dictionary
@concept{knowledge}->@concept{application}

// Fully expanded with properties
@concept{knowledge}:p{domain:"epistemology",nature:"structured"}->@concept{application}:p{domain:"practical",purpose:"usage"}
```

### 5. Integrity Verification

The verification stage ensures the decompressed content is complete and consistent:

```
@stage{verification}{
  @process{completeness_check}:p{purpose:"ensure_all_references_resolved"},
  @process{consistency_check}:p{purpose:"verify_logical_coherence"},
  @process{structural_validation}:p{purpose:"confirm_well_formed_result"},
  @process{semantic_validation}:p{purpose:"verify_meaning_preservation"}
}
```

## Decompression Algorithms

### 1. Dictionary-Based Decompression

```
@algorithm{dictionary_decompression}{
  @step{1}:p{action:"load_dictionary_definitions"},
  @step{2}:p{action:"identify_abbreviated_terms"},
  @step{3}:p{action:"replace_with_full_forms"},
  @step{4}:p{action:"recursively_process_nested_terms"}
}
```

Example implementation:
```
function expand_with_dictionary(compressed_text, dictionary):
  for each abbreviated_term, full_term in dictionary:
    compressed_text = replace_all(compressed_text, abbreviated_term, full_term)
  return compressed_text
```

### 2. Inheritance Resolution

```
@algorithm{inheritance_resolution}{
  @step{1}:p{action:"build_inheritance_hierarchy"},
  @step{2}:p{action:"traverse_bottom_up_for_property_collection"},
  @step{3}:p{action:"handle_property_overrides"},
  @step{4}:p{action:"apply_inherited_properties_to_children"}
}
```

Example:
```
function resolve_inheritance(entity_map):
  for each entity in entity_map:
    if entity has inheritance marker (^):
      parent = find_parent_entity(entity.parent_reference)
      inherited_properties = collect_properties(parent)
      apply_properties_with_overrides(entity, inherited_properties)
  return entity_map
```

### 3. Context-Based Expansion

```
@algorithm{context_expansion}{
  @step{1}:p{action:"identify_context_boundaries"},
  @step{2}:p{action:"establish_context_hierarchy"},
  @step{3}:p{action:"expand_entities_within_contexts"},
  @step{4}:p{action:"resolve_cross_context_references"}
}
```

Example:
```
function expand_contexts(parsed_structure):
  context_map = extract_contexts(parsed_structure)
  for each context in context_map:
    expand_entities_in_context(context)
    apply_context_properties(context)
  resolve_cross_context_references(context_map)
  return merged_structure(context_map)
```

### 4. Quantum Partition Expansion

```
@algorithm{quantum_expansion}{
  @step{1}:p{action:"identify_quantum_boundaries"},
  @step{2}:p{action:"expand_internal_quantum_content"},
  @step{3}:p{action:"process_quantum_relationships"},
  @step{4}:p{action:"integrate_quantum_partitions"}
}
```

Example:
```
function expand_quantum_partitions(parsed_structure):
  quanta = extract_quantum_partitions(parsed_structure)
  for each quantum in quanta:
    expanded_content = expand_content(quantum.content)
    apply_quantum_properties(expanded_content, quantum.properties)
  
  for each relationship in quantum_relationships:
    connect_quantum_partitions(relationship)
  
  return integrated_structure(quanta)
```

### 5. Template-Based Expansion

```
@algorithm{template_expansion}{
  @step{1}:p{action:"identify_template_definitions"},
  @step{2}:p{action:"collect_template_instances"},
  @step{3}:p{action:"substitute_parameters"},
  @step{4}:p{action:"integrate_expanded_templates"}
}
```

Example:
```
function expand_templates(parsed_structure):
  templates = extract_template_definitions(parsed_structure)
  instances = identify_template_instances(parsed_structure)
  
  for each instance in instances:
    template = find_matching_template(instance, templates)
    expanded = apply_parameters(template, instance.parameters)
    replace_instance_with_expansion(parsed_structure, instance, expanded)
  
  return parsed_structure
```

## Expansion Modes

```
@expansion_modes{
  @mode{full}:p{description:"complete_expansion_of_all_elements"},
  @mode{partial}:p{description:"expand_only_specified_sections"},
  @mode{progressive}:p{description:"layer_by_layer_expansion"},
  @mode{targeted}:p{description:"expand_elements_matching_criteria"},
  @mode{dynamic}:p{description:"adjust_expansion_based_on_context"}
}
```

Example mode selection:
```
$expand{mode:partial,sections:["core","architecture"]}
$expand{mode:progressive,stages:3}
$expand{mode:targeted,criteria:"domain:security"}
```

## Decompression Optimization Strategies

### 1. Lazy Expansion

Defers expansion until content is specifically needed:

```
@strategy{lazy_expansion}{
  @technique{reference_tracking}:p{purpose:"maintain_expansion_status"},
  @technique{on_demand_resolution}:p{purpose:"expand_when_referenced"},
  @technique{expansion_caching}:p{purpose:"store_expanded_results"}
}
```

### 2. Incremental Decompression

Processes content in manageable chunks:

```
@strategy{incremental_decompression}{
  @technique{chunking}:p{purpose:"divide_into_processable_units"},
  @technique{priority_ordering}:p{purpose:"expand_critical_elements_first"},
  @technique{dependency_tracking}:p{purpose:"maintain_reference_integrity"}
}
```

### 3. Parallel Expansion

Utilizes concurrent processing for efficiency:

```
@strategy{parallel_expansion}{
  @technique{independent_unit_identification}:p{purpose:"find_parallelizable_elements"},
  @technique{worker_pool_processing}:p{purpose:"distribute_expansion_tasks"},
  @technique{result_integration}:p{purpose:"combine_expanded_fragments"}
}
```

### 4. Contextual Prioritization

Prioritizes expansion based on relevance:

```
@strategy{contextual_prioritization}{
  @technique{relevance_assessment}:p{purpose:"determine_importance_to_task"},
  @technique{attention_focus}:p{purpose:"prioritize_central_elements"},
  @technique{peripheral_deferment}:p{purpose:"delay_less_relevant_expansion"}
}
```

## Recovery Mechanisms

### 1. Fault-Tolerant Decompression

Handles corrupted or partial content:

```
@mechanism{fault_tolerance}{
  @approach{error_detection}:p{purpose:"identify_corrupt_sections"},
  @approach{partial_recovery}:p{purpose:"salvage_intact_portions"},
  @approach{reconstruction}:p{purpose:"infer_missing_elements"}
}
```

### 2. Progressive Recovery

Restores functionality in stages:

```
@mechanism{progressive_recovery}{
  @stage{core}:p{purpose:"restore_essential_functionality"},
  @stage{structure}:p{purpose:"rebuild_organizational_framework"},
  @stage{detail}:p{purpose:"recover_specific_details"},
  @stage{verification}:p{purpose:"validate_recovered_content"}
}
```

### 3. Redundant Encoding

```
@mechanism{redundancy}{
  @approach{critical_duplication}:p{purpose:"store_vital_elements_redundantly"},
  @approach{distributed_storage}:p{purpose:"spread_information_across_structure"},
  @approach{cryptographic_verification}:p{purpose:"detect_corruption"}
}
```

]}
```

### Key Interfaces

```typescript
// Core interfaces (pseudocode)
interface QuantumEntity {
  type: 'entity' | 'reference' | 'property' | 'relationship' | 'context' | 'quantum';
  id?: string;
  value?: any;
  properties?: Record<string, any>;

  parse(input: string): QuantumEntity[];
  transform(ast: QuantumEntity[], options: TransformationOptions): any;
  compress(input: string | QuantumEntity[]): string;
  decompress(input: string): string;
}
```

### MDX Integration

```typescript
// MDX plugin (pseudocode)
export const quantumPlugin = () => ({
  name: 'quantum-mdx',
  rehype: {
    visitor: {
      'pre > code.language-qt': (node, file) => {
        const code = getText(node);
        const processor = new QuantumProcessor();
        const mermaidCode = processor.transform(

# Quantum Language Examples

This document provides practical examples of Quantum language usage, demonstrating compression techniques and their applications. Each example shows both the expanded knowledge representation and its compressed Quantum form.

## Basic Entity and Relationship Example

### Expanded Form

```
The concept of knowledge representation is a fundamental principle in artificial intelligence.
It encompasses methods for structuring information in formats that can be efficiently processed.
Knowledge representation connects to knowledge graphs, which organize information in networked structures.
The field of ontology provides theoretical foundations for knowledge representation.
```

## Inheritance-Based Compression Example

### Expanded Form

```
A REST API is a web service interface that follows representational state transfer principles.
It uses HTTP methods and follows statelessness, cacheability, and uniform interface constraints.
A GraphQL API is a web service interface that uses a query language for APIs.
It follows flexible data retrieval, type safety, and introspection principles.
Both REST and GraphQL APIs are web service interfaces with different architectural approaches.
```

## Quantum Partitioning Example

### Expanded Form

```
The authentication system includes:
- User credentials management
- Authentication protocols (OAuth, JWT, SAML)
- Session handling
- Password policies

The authorization system includes:
- Role definitions
- Permission assignments
- Access control rules
- Privilege management

Both systems are part of the security domain but serve different purposes.

Different contexts require different boundaries:
- For developers: focus on implementation details
- For administrators: focus on configuration options
- For auditors: focus on security compliance aspects
- For users: focus on login experience

## Compile a Complete Knowledge Domain

This example shows how a complete knowledge domain (Agile Development Methodology) would be compressed using Quantum language.

### Expanded Form (Summary)

```
Agile Software Development Methodology:

Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, 
customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software. It emerged as a response 
to traditional waterfall methodologies.

Core Values (from Agile Manifesto):
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Key Frameworks:
- Scrum: Organized around sprints with specific roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team)
- Kanban: Visual workflow management focused on limiting work in progress
- XP (Extreme Programming): Technical practices like pair programming and TDD
- Lean: Minimizing waste and maximizing value

Common Practices:
- Daily stand-up meetings
- User stories for requirements
- Continuous integration/delivery
- Retrospectives for process improvement
- Iterative development cycles

Benefits:
- Faster delivery of working features
- Better alignment with customer needs
- Improved team collaboration
- Ability to adapt to changing requirements
- Earlier identification of issues

## File: quantum/PARSER.md
````markdown
# Quantum Parser

The Quantum Parser is a bidirectional translation engine that converts between expanded knowledge representation and compressed Quantum notation. This document defines the parsing mechanisms and transformation rules.

## Parser Architecture

The parser operates as a bidirectional translation system with the following components:

```
@parser{
  @module{tokenizer}:p{role:"decomposition"},
  @module{analyzer}:p{role:"structure_mapping"},
  @module{generator}:p{role:"output_creation"},
  @module{validator}:p{role:"integrity_checking"},
  
  tokenizer->analyzer->generator:p{flow:"compression"},
  generator<-analyzer<-tokenizer:p{flow:"decompression"},
  validator<->[tokenizer,analyzer,generator]:p{role:"verification"}
}
```

## Parsing Phases

### 1. Tokenization

The tokenizer breaks input into atomic elements:

```
@tokenizer{
  @phase{lexical}:p{purpose:"character_sequence_recognition"},
  @phase{syntactic}:p{purpose:"pattern_identification"},
  @phase{semantic}:p{purpose:"meaning_assignment"},
  
  @token_types{
    @type{entity}:p{pattern:"@[a-z_]+({[^}]*})?"},
    @type{reference}:p{pattern:"#[a-z_]+"},
    @type{property}:p{pattern:":p{[^}]*}"},
    @type{relation}:p{pattern:"(->|<-|<->|--|==>|~>)"},
    @type{context}:p{pattern:"\\[[^\\]]*\\]\\{[^}]*\\}"},
    @type{quantum}:p{pattern:"q\\{[^\\}]*\\}\\[[^\\]]*\\]"},
    @type{directive}:p{pattern:"\\$[a-z_]+\\{[^}]*\\}"}
  }
}
```

Example tokenization:
```
Input: "@concept{knowledge}:p{domain:\"core\"}->@concept{application}"
Tokens: [ENTITY("concept","knowledge"), PROPERTY("domain","core"), RELATION("->"), ENTITY("concept","application")]
```

### 2. Structural Analysis

The analyzer builds a structural representation:

```
@analyzer{
  @phase{dependency}:p{purpose:"relationship_mapping"},
  @phase{hierarchy}:p{purpose:"inheritance_resolution"},
  @phase{context}:p{purpose:"boundary_determination"},
  
  @structures{
    @structure{entity_map}:p{role:"definition_registry"},
    @structure{relation_graph}:p{role:"connection_network"},
    @structure{context_tree}:p{role:"scoping_hierarchy"},
    @structure{quantum_partitions}:p{role:"coherence_boundaries"}
  }
}
```

Example analysis:
```
Entity Map: {
  "concept:knowledge": {properties: {domain: "core"}},
  "concept:application": {properties: {}}
}
Relation Graph: {
  edges: [{"concept:knowledge" -> "concept:application"}]
}
```

### 3. Generation

The generator produces output in target format:

```
@generator{
  @phase{template}:p{purpose:"pattern_application"},
  @phase{optimization}:p{purpose:"redundancy_removal"},
  @phase{formatting}:p{purpose:"readability_adjustment"},
  
  @targets{
    @target{quantum}:p{format:"compressed"},
    @target{expanded}:p{format:"detailed"},
    @target{hybrid}:p{format:"selective_expansion"}
  }
}
```

Example generation:
```
Compressed: "@c{k}:p{d:\"c\"}->@c{a}"
Expanded: "The concept of knowledge in the core domain relates to the concept of application"
```

### 4. Validation

The validator ensures correctness:

```
@validator{
  @check{syntax}:p{purpose:"well_formedness"},
  @check{references}:p{purpose:"link_integrity"},
  @check{semantics}:p{purpose:"meaning_preservation"},
  
  @error_handling{
    @strategy{recovery}:p{approach:"best_effort_continuation"},
    @strategy{reporting}:p{approach:"detailed_diagnostics"}
  }
}
```

## Transformation Rules

### Compression Transformations

1. **Entity Compression**
   ```
   @entity{identifier}:p{key:value} → @e{id}:p{k:v}
   ```

2. **Common Term Dictionary**
   ```
   $dictionary{
     concept: c,
     knowledge: k,
     application: a,
     implementation: i,
     relationship: r,
     property: p,
     system: s,
     component: co,
     integration: in,
     development: d,
     architecture: ar,
     framework: f
   }
   ```

3. **Relationship Chains**
   ```
   @a->@b->@c->@d → @a->@b->#chain{1}
   $chain{1}: @c->@d
   ```

4. **Property Inheritance Expansion**
   ```
   @child^parent:p{specific:value} 
   → 
   @child:p{inherited_prop1:value1,...,specific:value}
   ```

5. **Context Grouping**
   ```
   [context]{@a,@b,@c} → [ctx]{@a,@b,@c}
   ```

6. **Pattern Templates**
   ```
   Repeated: @x->@y:p{type:value}
   Template: $t{relation}{@x,@y,value} → @x->@y:p{type:value}
   Usage: $t{relation}{@a,@b,normal}
   ```

### Decompression Transformations

1. **Abbreviated Entity Expansion**
   ```
   @e{id}:p{k:v} → @entity{identifier}:p{key:value}
   ```

2. **Dictionary Substitution**
   ```
   @c → @concept
   k → knowledge
   ```

3. **Chain Resolution**
   ```
   @a->@b->#chain{1} + $chain{1}: @c->@d → @a->@b->@c->@d
   ```

4. **Inheritance Resolution**
   ```
   @child^parent (where parent has properties p1,p2)
   →
   @child:p{p1:v1,p2:v2} (with parent's property values)
   ```

5. **Context Expansion**
   ```
   [ctx]{...} → [context]{...}
   ```

6. **Template Expansion**
   ```
   $t{relation}{@a,@b,normal} → @a->@b:p{type:normal}
   ```

## Algorithm Outlines

### Compression Algorithm

```
function compress(knowledge_representation):
  tokens = tokenize(knowledge_representation)
  structure = analyze(tokens)
  
  // Optimization phase
  optimize_entities(structure)
  optimize_relationships(structure)
  build_dictionary(structure)
  identify_patterns(structure)
  create_templates(structure)
  
  // Generation phase
  compressed = generate_compressed(structure)
  add_bootstrap_key(compressed)
  add_integrity_checks(compressed)
  
  return compressed
```

### Decompression Algorithm

```
function decompress(quantum_representation):
  verify_bootstrap(quantum_representation)
  tokens = tokenize(quantum_representation)
  structure = analyze(tokens)
  
  // Expansion phase
  expand_abbreviations(structure)
  resolve_references(structure)
  expand_templates(structure)
  resolve_inheritance(structure)
  restore_contexts(structure)
  
  // Generation phase
  expanded = generate_expanded(structure)
  validate_integrity(expanded)
  
  return expanded
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **Parsing Efficiency**
   - Use character-level state machines for tokenization
   - Implement stream processing for large documents
   - Cache common patterns and expansions

2. **Memory Optimization**
   - Use reference-based structure representations
   - Implement lazy expansion for nested structures
   - Utilize indexed lookups for entity resolution

3. **Incremental Processing**
   - Support partial parsing and generation
   - Implement progressive optimization
   - Enable streaming compression/decompression

## Error Handling

```
@error_handling{
  @category{syntax}:p{recovery:"attempt_correction"},
  @category{reference}:p{recovery:"create_placeholder"},
  @category{semantic}:p{recovery:"best_effort_interpretation"},
  
  @reporting{
    @level{warning}:p{action:"log"},
    @level{error}:p{action:"log_and_report"},
    @level{critical}:p{action:"halt_and_report"}
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. The parser should preserve round-trip integrity (compression → decompression → original)
2. Performance optimizations should not sacrifice accuracy
3. Error recovery should preserve as much information as possible
4. Modular design should allow for format extensions
5. Stream processing should handle documents larger than available memory

## Future Extensions

1. **Adaptive Dictionary**: Learn common terms from the corpus
2. **Semantic Compression**: Utilize meaning-preserving transformations
3. **Domain-Specific Rules**: Specialized compression for knowledge domains
4. **Partial Decompression**: Selective expansion of only needed sections
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add detail levels to decompression output

}
```

## File: quantum/SYNTAX.md
````markdown
# Quantum Language Syntax Specification

This document defines the formal syntax for Quantum, an LLM-optimized knowledge representation language designed for maximum semantic density with minimal token usage.

## Core Notation Elements

### 1. Entity Definition and Reference

```
@entity{id}    # Define an entity with optional identifier
#id           # Reference a previously defined entity
```

Example:
```
@concept{knowledge_graph}:p{type:"representation"}
#knowledge_graph->@concept{node}:p{role:"atomic_unit"}
```

### 2. Relationship Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `->` | Directed relationship | `@source->@target` |
| `<-` | Reverse relationship | `@target<-@source` |
| `<->` | Bidirectional relationship | `@concept1<->@concept2` |
| `--` | Undirected association | `@concept1--@concept2` |
| `==>` | Strong implication/causation | `@cause==>@effect` |
| `~>` | Probabilistic/weak relationship | `@input~>@possible_outcome` |

Relationships can be chained: `@a->@b->@c`

### 3. Property Assignment

```
:p{key:value}                       # Single property
:p{key1:value1,key2:value2}         # Multiple properties
:t{tag1,tag2,tag3}                  # Tag assignment
```

Example:
```
@concept:p{importance:"high",domain:"core"}:t{foundational,critical}
```

### 4. Inheritance

```
@child^parent                  # Basic inheritance
@child^parent1+parent2         # Multiple inheritance
@child^parent\exception        # Inheritance with exception
```

Example:
```
@specialized_method^general_method:p{context:"specific"}
@hybrid^approach1+approach2:p{purpose:"integration"}
```

### 5. Contextual Boundaries

```
[context]{content}             # Scope content to context
[context1+context2]{content}   # Multiple context scoping
[*]{global_content}            # Global context
[!context]{exclusion}          # Explicitly not in context
```

Example:
```
[technical]{@concept:p{definition:"technical explanation"}}
[business+strategy]{@concept:p{value:"business impact"}}
```

### 6. Shorthand Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `+` | Include/add | `base+extension` |
| `-` | Exclude/remove | `set-subset` |
| `?` | Query/condition | `condition?result:alternative` |
| `!` | Negation/inverse | `!condition` |
| `*` | Wildcard/any | `pattern*suffix` |
| `&` | Logical AND | `condition1&condition2` |
| `\|` | Logical OR | `option1\|option2` |

### 7. Templating

```
t(template_name){arg1,arg2}    # Template with arguments
d(pattern){replacement}        # Define pattern replacement
m{pattern}                     # Match pattern
```

Example:
```
@t{system}[input->processing->output]
t(system){data,algorithm,result}
```

### 8. Quantum Partitioning

```
@p:blend{view1+view2}[content] # Combined perspectives
@p:focus{area}[content]        # Attention-focused perspective
@p:adapt{context}[content]     # Context-adapted perspective
```

Example:
```
@p:technical[@system:p{architecture:"detailed"}]
@p:user[@system:p{interface:"simplified"}]
@p:scale{macro}[@architecture:p{overview:"system-wide"}]
@p:blend{developer+user}[@interface:p{design:"balanced"}]
```

### 10. Temporal Annotations

#### Basic Versioning
```
t:v1[content]                   # Content from version
t:delta{v1->v2}[changes]        # Changes between versions
t:history{v1,v2,v3}             # Historical sequence
```

#### Evolution Patterns
```
t:pattern{expansion}[content]   # Growth through addition
t:pattern{refinement}[content]  # Increased precision
t:pattern{restructuring}[content] # Organization change
t:pattern{obsolescence}[content] # Outdated knowledge
```

#### Temporal Dynamics
```
t:velocity{rate}[content]       # Change speed marker
t:lifespan{duration}[content]   # Expected validity period
t:trajectory{direction}[path]   # Evolution direction
```

#### Temporal Navigation
```
t:timeline[marker1,marker2]     # Sequential reference points
t:milestone{name}[criteria]     # Significant temporal point
t:projection{confidence}[state] # Predicted future state
```

Example:
```
@concept:t:v1[initial_definition]
@concept:t:v2[evolved_definition]
@concept:t:pattern{refinement}[precision_improvements]
@concept:t:velocity{stable}[core_principles]
@concept:t:trajectory{expansion}[future_development]
```

### 11. Graph Structure Notation

```
@node{id}                    # Define graph node
#id1->#id2                   # Edge between nodes
(#id1,#id2)->#id3            # Multiple sources
#id1->(#id2,#id3)            # Multiple targets
path{#id1->#id2->#id3}       # Defined path
```

Example:
```
@node{start}:p{type:"entry"}
@node{process}:p{type:"transformation"}
@node{end}:p{type:"output"}
path{#start->#process->#end}:p{name:"main_flow"}
```

## Grammar Definition

### Tokens

```
ENTITY      ::= '@' IDENTIFIER ['{' ID_VALUE '}']
REFERENCE   ::= '#' IDENTIFIER
PROPERTY    ::= ':p{' PROP_LIST '}'
TAG         ::= ':t{' TAG_LIST '}'
INHERITANCE ::= '^' PARENT_LIST
CONTEXT     ::= '[' CONTEXT_LIST ']{' CONTENT '}'
QUANTUM     ::= 'q' [':' QUANTUM_TYPE] '{' BOUNDARY '}' [':' ATTRIBUTES] '[' CONTENT ']'
PERSPECTIVE ::= '@p' [':' PERSPECTIVE_TYPE] ['{' PERSPECTIVE_PARAMS '}'] '[' CONTENT ']'
TEMPORAL    ::= 't' [':' TEMPORAL_TYPE] ['{' TEMPORAL_PARAMS '}'] '[' CONTENT ']'
```

### Production Rules

```
expression        ::= entity | relationship | property_assignment | context_block | quantum_block | 
                      perspective_block | temporal_block
entity            ::= ENTITY [PROPERTY] [TAG] [INHERITANCE]
relationship      ::= source RELATION_OP target [PROPERTY]
source            ::= entity | REFERENCE | '(' entity_list ')'
target            ::= entity | REFERENCE | '(' entity_list ')'
property_assignment ::= entity PROPERTY
context_block     ::= CONTEXT
quantum_block     ::= QUANTUM
perspective_block ::= PERSPECTIVE
temporal_block    ::= TEMPORAL
quantum_type      ::= 'coherence' | 'complexity' | 'purpose' | 'context' | 'perspective' | 'temporal'
perspective_type  ::= 'domain' | 'scale' | 'cognitive' | 'blend' | 'focus' | 'adapt'
temporal_type     ::= 'pattern' | 'velocity' | 'lifespan' | 'trajectory' | 'milestone' | 'projection'
```

## Syntax Validation Rules

1. Every reference (`#id`) must have a corresponding definition (`@entity{id}`)
2. Inheritance sources (`^parent`) must be defined before use
3. Context identifiers in `[context]` must be defined as entities
4. Quantum boundaries must reference valid contextual domains
5. Template arguments must match template parameter count
6. Path definitions must reference existing nodes
7. Properties must use valid key formats (alphanumeric with underscores)
8. Nested structures must have balanced delimiters

## Compression Directives

Special directives that control compression behavior:

```
$compress{ratio:high}         # Set compression ratio
$preserve{critical_paths}     # Mark elements for preservation
$optimize{token_count}        # Optimization target
$format{dense|readable}       # Output format preference
```

## Syntax Highlighting Recommendations

For improved readability in documentation:

- Entities (`@concept`) - Blue
- References (`#id`) - Cyan
- Relationships (`->`, `<->`) - Red
- Properties (`:p{...}`) - Green
- Inheritance (`^parent`) - Purple
- Contexts (`[context]`) - Yellow
- Quantum markers (`q{...}`) - Magenta
- Perspective markers (`@p:...`) - Teal
- Temporal annotations (`t:...`) - Orange

## Version Notes

This syntax specification is for Quantum v1.0. The language is designed to be extensible with backward compatibility.
