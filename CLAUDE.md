# Atlas Development Guidelines for Claude Code

This file contains essential instructions and guidelines for Claude Code when working on the Atlas project. These instructions serve as a reference for both human developers and Claude to ensure consistent development practices.

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Clean Break Philosophy with Careful Testing

**CRITICAL**: Prioritize a best-in-class, robust, and consistent API over backwards compatibility.

- Don't hesitate to refactor or replace incorrect implementations, but document breaking changes thoroughly.
- When testing functionality, never temporarily simplify production code - instead, create separate test files or modules.
- Always maintain the full LangGraph integration and multi-agent architecture in the main codebase.
- Use temporary test environments to isolate features for testing rather than removing complexity from production code.

### 2. Incremental Development with Quality Focus

- Build new features using high-quality implementations from the start.
- Don't be afraid to rewrite or replace existing components if they aren't meeting quality standards.
- Prefer clean, maintainable code over perfect backward compatibility.
- Use composition over inheritance when possible to increase flexibility and testability.

### 3. Testing Strategy

- Create isolated test modules when testing specific components.
- Implement unit tests alongside feature development.
- When testing complex workflows, create test-specific wrapper modules rather than modifying production code.

### 4. Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error handling around all external API calls.
- Add appropriate fallbacks for critical components.
- Log detailed error information for debugging.
- Never let errors silently fail in production code.

## Code Structure and Style Guidelines

### File Organization

- Follow the established module structure (agents, core, graph, knowledge, orchestration, tools, scripts).
- Place new features in the appropriate module based on functionality.
- Create new subdirectories when introducing conceptually distinct components.
- Organize utility scripts in the `scripts` module with appropriate subdirectories:
  - `scripts/debug/`: Utilities for debugging and inspecting the system
  - `scripts/testing/`: Testing utilities and test runners

### Code Style

- Use comprehensive type hints for all function parameters and return values.
- Document all classes and functions with detailed docstrings.
- Maintain consistent naming conventions: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly convey their purpose.

### Documentation

- Document all key components and their interactions.
- Update documentation when adding or modifying features.
- Include docstrings with parameters, return values, and examples.
- Add inline comments for complex logic or algorithms.

## Working with LangGraph

### Graph Workflow Development

- Maintain the LangGraph StateGraph architecture for all agent workflows.
- Define clear node functions with appropriate state transformations.
- Use conditional edges for complex decision logic.
- Document graph topology with comments and diagrams.

### State Management

- Use the established state models (AgentState, ControllerState).
- Extend state classes with new fields rather than creating incompatible alternatives.
- Ensure all state mutations are clean and traceable.
- Verify state integrity before and after graph execution.

## Multi-Agent System Guidelines

### Controller-Worker Architecture

- Maintain the controller-worker pattern for all multi-agent operations.
- Follow the established communication protocols between agents.
- Use the agent registry for dynamic agent management.
- Document agent roles and responsibilities clearly.

### Agent Communication

- Design clean interfaces for agent communication.
- Use structured message formats with appropriate metadata.
- Ensure task context is properly passed between agents.
- Implement robust error handling for inter-agent communication.

## Database and Knowledge Management

### ChromaDB Integration

- Always use the PersistentClient for ChromaDB operations.
- Implement proper connection pooling and retry logic.
- Add appropriate error handling for database operations.
- Document data schemas and collection structures.

### Document Processing

- Follow the established chunking and processing strategies.
- Add proper metadata to all stored documents.
- Implement version control for knowledge base updates.
- Ensure proper indexing for efficient retrieval.

## Testing and Debugging

### Testing Directory Structure

Atlas differentiates between formal tests, usage examples, and testing utilities:

- **`atlas/tests/`**: Contains all unit tests and integration tests
  - Test files are named with a `test_` prefix (e.g., `test_models.py`)
  - Each test file focuses on testing a specific module or component

- **`atlas/scripts/testing/`**: Contains utility scripts for running tests
  - `run_tests.py`: Unified test runner with various test types
  - Other utilities for test setup and configuration

- **`examples/`**: Contains example scripts demonstrating Atlas functionality
  - These are **not** formal tests but usage demonstrations
  - Can be run with or without an API key (using `SKIP_API_KEY_CHECK=true`)

### Test Implementation

- Create comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Implement mock tests that don't require API keys
- Use the agent registry for testing with different agent implementations
- Create mocked provider implementations for testing without API calls
- Document testing strategies and expected outcomes

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Mock Tests**: Use mocked components to test without API dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Verify that different components work together
- **API Tests**: Test real API interactions (requires API keys)

### Debugging

- Add detailed logging throughout the codebase
- Use the telemetry module to trace function calls and performance
- Implement debug modes with increased verbosity
- Create visualization tools for complex workflows
- Document common debugging scenarios and solutions

## Implementation Notes for Claude Code

1. When working on this project, Claude should:
   - Start by understanding the existing architecture before making changes
   - Follow the file structure and coding patterns already established
   - Ensure all new code maintains compatibility with the existing system
   - Add detailed docstrings and comments for any new code
   - Test suggestions thoroughly before proposing them

2. When encountering a challenging implementation:
   - Break the problem down into smaller, manageable pieces
   - Prototype solutions in a way that doesn't disrupt existing code
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
   - Document design decisions and alternatives considered

3. When facing uncertainty:
   - Prefer asking clarifying questions over making assumptions
   - Reference existing code for patterns and conventions
   - Suggest alternatives with pros and cons clearly outlined
   - Be explicit about any limitations or potential issues

## Development Environment Setup

### Requirements

- Python version: >=3.13
- Key dependencies: langgraph, chromadb, anthropic, pydantic, pathspec
- Environment variables required: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- Default DB path: ~/atlas_chroma_db
- Claude model: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219

### Setting Up Development Environment

We use `uv` for virtual environment and package management. If you don't have it installed:

```bash
# Install uv
pip install uv
```

Setting up the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone <repository-url>
cd atlas

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Install tools
uv pip install ruff black mypy pytest
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or set environment variables directly:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# On Windows:
# set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Running Atlas

### Basic Usage

Atlas can be run in several modes, including CLI mode for interactive use, query mode for one-off questions, and ingest mode for adding documents to the knowledge base:

```bash
# Run in CLI mode with default system prompt
uv run python main.py -m cli

# Run with custom system prompt
uv run python main.py -m cli -s path/to/your/system_prompt.md

# Ingest documents
uv run python main.py -m ingest -d path/to/your/documents/

# Run in controller mode with parallel processing
uv run python main.py -m controller --parallel

# Run a single query
uv run python main.py -m query -q "What is the trimodal methodology in Atlas?"
```

### Using the Query Client

Atlas provides a lightweight query-only client that can be used from other applications or agentic systems. This is demonstrated in the examples directory:

```python
from atlas import create_query_client

# Create a client
client = create_query_client()

# Simple query with LLM response
response = client.query("What is the trimodal methodology?")
print(response)

# Retrieve documents without requiring LLM response (no API key needed)
documents = client.retrieve_only("knowledge graph structure")
print(f"Found {len(documents)} relevant documents")

# Streaming response with callback
def print_streaming(delta, full_text):
    print(delta, end="", flush=True)

client.query_streaming("Explain conditional edge routing", print_streaming)
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests
uv python -m pytest

# Run specific test file
uv python -m pytest test_atlas.py

# Run with coverage
uv python -m pytest --cov=atlas

# Run mock tests
uv python mock_test.py

# Run linting
uv tool run ruff check

# Run type checking
uv tool run mypy .

# Format code
uv tool run black .
```

### Dependency Management

Atlas uses the following key dependencies with specific version requirements to ensure compatibility:

```
langgraph==0.4.1
chromadb>=1.0.7
anthropic>=0.50.0
pydantic>=2.11.4
pathspec>=0.12.1
```

To install or update dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Add a specific dependency
uv add <package_name>==<version>

# Update all dependencies
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
uv pip sync requirements.txt
```

When updating dependency versions, ensure compatibility with existing code. Some packages have breaking API changes between versions that require code adaptations:

#### LangGraph Version Compatibility

- langgraph 0.0.27 ‚Üí 0.4.1 upgrade notes:
  - `MemorySaver` import path changed to `from langgraph.saver import MemorySaver`
  - `CheckpointAt` is now available in the checkpoint module
  - The graph compilation API has been enhanced with additional options
  - State management has been improved with more type safety

#### Code Adaptations for LangGraph Upgrades

When updating from older versions of langgraph, make these changes:

```python
# Old import (0.0.27)
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.checkpoint import MemorySaver

# New imports (0.4.1)
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.saver import MemorySaver
```

For projects using checkpoint features:

```python
# New checkpoint imports
from langgraph.checkpoint.base import CheckpointAt, Checkpoint
```

#### Other Dependency Upgrades

**Anthropic API Changes (anthropic ‚â•0.50.0)**:
- The Claude API has evolved with improved streaming capabilities
- Messages API is now the standard for all interactions
- Content handling now supports structured formats and multi-modal inputs
- Example usage:
  ```python
  # Modern Anthropic API usage
  response = client.messages.create(
      model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
      max_tokens=2000,
      system=system_prompt,
      messages=message_history
  )
  ```

**ChromaDB Changes (chromadb ‚â•1.0.7)**:
- Improved persistent storage handling
- Enhanced embedding functionality with better model support
- More robust error handling and connection management
- Metadata filtering improvements

**Pydantic Upgrades (pydantic ‚â•2.11.4)**:
- Better type validation and error messages
- Enhanced schema generation and serialization
- Improved performance for model validation

## Environment Setup and Troubleshooting

### Development Environment

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Install all dependencies
uv sync
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Import Errors
If you encounter import errors like `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError`, check:
1. That all dependencies are installed with correct versions
2. That import paths match the installed package versions
3. Run `uv sync` to ensure all dependencies are up to date

#### LangGraph Compatibility Issues
If you encounter errors with LangGraph functionality:
1. Verify the LangGraph version with `uv pip show langgraph`
2. Check that import paths match the installed version
3. If needed, install the exact version specified in pyproject.toml: `uv add langgraph==0.4.1`

#### API Changes in Dependencies
When upgrading dependencies:
1. Review the changelog or release notes for each package
2. Test key functionality after upgrading
3. Update code to use new API patterns where needed

## Testing

### Running Tests

#### Using the Test Runner Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Run mock tests (fast, reliable, no API key required)
uv run python atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py --test-type mock

# Run unit tests for all modules
uv run python atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py --test-type unit

# Run unit tests for a specific module
uv run python atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py --test-type unit --module models

# Run minimal tests (basic functionality verification)
uv run python atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py --test-type minimal

# Run API tests for the base agent (requires API key)
uv run python atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py --test-type api --api-test base

# Run API tests with a custom query
uv run python atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py --test-type api --api-test base --query "Your query here"

# Run all tests (both mock and real tests)
uv run python atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py --test-type all
```

#### Using Direct Test Commands

```bash
# Run the mock tests directly (no API key required)
uv run python mock_test.py

# Run only the base agent test (requires API key)
uv run python test_atlas.py --test base

# Run specific base agent test with custom query (requires API key)
uv run python test_atlas.py --test base --query "Your query here"
```

#### Running Example Files

```bash
# Run the query example
uv run python examples/query_example.py

# Run the retrieval example
uv run python examples/retrieval_example.py

# Run the streaming example
uv run python examples/streaming_example.py

# Run examples without an API key (using mock responses)
SKIP_API_KEY_CHECK=true uv run python examples/query_example.py
```

> **Important Testing Notes:**
>
> 1. The unified test runner (`atlas/scripts/testing/run_tests.py`) is the recommended way to run tests
> 2. Mock tests are the most reliable way to verify code functionality without requiring API keys
> 3. The real tests using API calls work reliably for the base agent, but may encounter issues with controller and workflow components
> 4. Always run the mock tests before making changes to ensure you have a working baseline
> 5. Example files in the `examples/` directory demonstrate functionality but are not formal tests

### API Cost Tracking

Atlas includes built-in cost tracking for Anthropic API calls. This feature helps monitor usage during development and testing to avoid unexpected charges.

When running real tests with an API key, the system will automatically report:
- Input tokens used and their cost
- Output tokens used and their cost
- Total API cost for the operation

Example output:
```
API Usage: 683 input tokens, 502 output tokens
Estimated Cost: $0.009579 (Input: $0.002049, Output: $0.007530)
```

This cost tracking is based on current Anthropic pricing for the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model:
- Input tokens: $3 per million tokens
- Output tokens: $15 per million tokens

If Anthropic updates their pricing, you might need to update the cost calculation in the agent class.

### Creating New Tests

When creating new tests:

1. Create test files in the project root or a `tests/` directory
2. Name test files with `test_` prefix (e.g., `test_agents.py`)
3. Name test functions with `test_` prefix
4. Use pytest fixtures for common setup

Example test:

```python
def test_atlas_agent():
    agent = AtlasAgent()
    response = agent.process_message("test query")
    assert response is not None
```

## Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference related issues or tasks in commit messages
- Group related changes in single commits
- Ensure the codebase remains in a working state after each commit

## Examples and Templates

### Examples Directory

The `examples/` directory contains demonstration scripts that show how to use Atlas:

- `query_example.py`: Demonstrates the query client with various features
- `retrieval_example.py`: Shows document retrieval without requiring an API key
- `streaming_example.py`: Demonstrates streaming responses with callbacks

These examples serve as a starting point for integrating Atlas into your projects. They can be run with or without an API key using the `SKIP_API_KEY_CHECK=true` environment variable.

### Project Structure

When creating new features, follow the established project structure:

```
atlas/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py                  # Core exports for the package
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/                      # Agent implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/                        # Core functionality (config, env, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ graph/                       # LangGraph implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knowledge/                   # Knowledge management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                      # Provider implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestration/               # Agent orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                     # Utility scripts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug/                   # Debugging utilities
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing/                 # Testing utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                       # Test modules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/                       # Tool implementations
```

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high-quality, robust implementation of the Atlas framework while continually expanding its capabilities.
