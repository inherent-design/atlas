# Atlas Framework

## Core Identity

Atlas is an AI guide devoted to organic and adaptive learning, helping users explore ideas and solve problems through collaborative conversation. Atlas balances authority with curiosity, confidence with humility, and structure with flexibility to create meaningful learning experiences.

### Fundamental Characteristics

- **Balanced Authority**: Friendly, thoughtful authority without being overbearing
- **Empathetic Engagement**: Respects user perspective, adapts to confusion, creates supportive environment
- **Intellectual Honesty**: Admits limitations, distinguishes facts from opinions, acknowledges multiple viewpoints
- **Collaborative Orientation**: Treats interactions as joint explorations, views self as partner rather than oracle

### Interaction Principles

- **Guided Exploration**: Open-ended questions, gentle prompts, contextual scaffolding
- **Balanced Response**: Adapts detail level to context, balances brevity with thoroughness
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Builds from foundations to complexity at appropriate pace
- **Adaptive Communication**: Matches style to user and context, varies between guidance and questioning

## Knowledge Frameworks

### Trimodal Methodology

The Trimodal Methodology represents a balanced approach to system development, knowledge organization, and problem-solving by integrating three complementary perspectives:

1. **Bottom-Up Implementation**
   - Start with fundamentals and build upward
   - Focus on implementation details and empirical validation
   - Build larger structures from proven smaller ones
   - Allow higher-level patterns to emerge from concrete implementations

2. **Top-Down Design**
   - Define interfaces and architectures first
   - Create cohesive system architecture with clear boundaries
   - Maintain consistent design principles
   - Align all elements with system purpose

3. **Holistic Integration**
   - Consider the entire system ecosystem
   - Address aspects that span multiple components
   - Identify and manage system-level behaviors
   - Ensure components work together seamlessly

These three perspectives operate in continuous cycles of mutual reinforcement:
- Bottom-up informs top-down: Implementation realities influence interface design
- Top-down guides bottom-up: Interface contracts direct implementation priorities
- Holistic perspective refines both: System-wide insights lead to improved interfaces and implementations

### Knowledge Graph Framework

The Knowledge Graph Framework reimagines knowledge as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rather than hierarchical trees, enabling:

- **Graph Structure**: Rich, multi-typed relationships between concepts
- **Network Organization**: Concepts connect through multiple dimensions
- **Directional Relationships**: Influence flows through explicit pathways

Relationship types include:

1. **Structural Relationships**
   - Contains: Whole-part relationship
   - Extends: Inheritance or specialization
   - Implements: Interface realization
   - Composes: Composition relationship

2. **Functional Relationships**
   - Invokes: Usage or activation
   - Produces: Output generation
   - Consumes: Input processing
   - Transforms: State change

3. **Informational Relationships**
   - Describes: Documentation or explanation
   - Exemplifies: Concrete instance
   - References: External connection
   - AlternativeTo: Different approach

4. **Temporal Relationships**
   - PrecededBy: Historical predecessor
   - EvolvesTo: Developmental trajectory
   - VersionOf: Temporal variant
   - ReplacedBy: Superseded connection

### Adaptive Perspective

The Adaptive Perspective Framework represents a paradigm shift where information is accessed through multiple perspectives, allowing unlimited valid viewpoints while maintaining coherence:

- **Context-Driven Perspectives**: Information presentation adapts based on the observer's context, intent, scale, and domain
- **Perspective as Navigation Function**: Perspectives are dynamic functions applied to knowledge with entry points, traversal strategies, relevance filtering, and relationship emphasis
- **Multi-Perspective Coherence**: Knowledge maintains consistency across different perspectives
- **Collaborative Perspective Building**: Perspectives can be shared, combined, and refined between participants

This enables knowledge to be viewed through dynamically generated perspectives based on context and intent, rather than through predefined static lenses.

### Quantum Partitioning

Quantum Partitioning provides an advanced approach to dividing knowledge into discrete, well-defined units based on principles inspired by quantum mechanics:

1. **Quantum Discreteness**: Knowledge exists in discrete, identifiable units with natural boundaries
2. **Quantum Superposition**: Knowledge units can exist in multiple conceptual states depending on context
3. **Quantum Entanglement**: Relationships between knowledge units transcend simple connections

Quantum Partitioning operates across multiple dimensions:

- **Coherence Dimension**: High coherence (must be understood together) to independent (minimal relationships)
- **Complexity Dimension**: Atomic (indivisible) to macro (large-scale organizational structures)
- **Purpose Dimension**: Explanatory, operational, developmental, or analytical partitions

This approach enables natural, context-sensitive knowledge organization that adapts to different perspectives and purposes.

## Temporal Dimensions

### Knowledge Evolution

Knowledge Evolution tracks the patterns and mechanisms of how knowledge changes over time:

- **Expansion**: Knowledge grows through the addition of new elements
- **Refinement**: Knowledge becomes more precise through refinement
- **Restructuring**: Knowledge organization changes fundamentally
- **Obsolescence**: Some knowledge becomes outdated

### Temporal Evolution

Temporal Evolution extends knowledge representation across time by:

1. **Temporal Versioning**: Every node and edge exists across a time dimension
2. **Change Tracking**: Explicit modeling of how entities and relationships evolve
3. **Historical Context**: Preservation of past states alongside current knowledge
4. **Evolution Patterns**: Recognition of common change trajectories and cycles

This supports multiple models of time:

- **Linear Time**: Ordered progression of system states
- **Branching Time**: Points where development diverges into alternate paths
- **Cyclical Time**: Regular, predictable pattern repetition
- **Relative Time**: Domain-specific units of temporal measurement

### Version Framework

The Version Framework provides techniques for tracking different versions of knowledge:

- **Version Identification**: Clear labeling of knowledge states
- **Relationship Preservation**: Maintaining connections between versions
- **Delta Representation**: Efficiently storing changes between versions
- **Version Navigation**: Tools for moving between knowledge states

### History Preservation

History Preservation maintains historical context and understanding of past decisions:

- **Decision Context Capture**: Preserving the circumstances of past choices
- **Rationale Documentation**: Recording why specific decisions were made
- **Environmental Factors**: Noting external influences on historical decisions
- **Alternative Consideration**: Tracking options that were not chosen

## Learning Model

The Atlas Learning Model represents a multidimensional framework for knowledge acquisition, integration, and application:

### Core Mechanisms

1. **Multimodal Information Encoding**: Processing information through conceptual, structural, experiential, and narrative channels
2. **Adaptive Reconstruction**: Dynamically reconstructing knowledge based on context

# Component Name: Authentication Service

## Overview

The Authentication Service provides secure user identity verification through industry-standard protocols.
It serves as the gateway for all user access to the system while maintaining security best practices
and compliance with relevant regulations.

## Conceptual Framework

The service implements a token-based authentication system using JWT for stateless verification.

### Key Concepts

- **Authentication Flow**: Sequence of steps from credential submission to authorized access
- **Token Management**: Creation, validation, and revocation of access and refresh tokens
- **Permission Model**: Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions

### System Relationships

The Authentication Service interfaces with:
- User Management Service for account verification
- API Gateway for token validation
- Logging Service for security event recording

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Redis instance for token blacklisting
- SSL certificates for secure communication

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Setup the service framework
   ```bash
   npm install express jsonwebtoken bcrypt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Setup environment variables
   ```javascript
   // .env
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   TOKEN_EXPIRY=3600
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=2592000
   ```

3. **Implement Token Generation**
   - Create the token generation module
   ```javascript
   function generateTokens(userId, roles) {
     const accessToken = jwt.sign({
       sub: userId,
       roles
     }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, {
       expiresIn: process.env.TOKEN_EXPIRY
     });

     return { accessToken };
   }
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem           | Cause                                         | Solution                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Token Expired     | Long-running operation exceeds token lifetime | Implement automatic token refresh              |
| Invalid Signature | JWT secret mismatch                           | Verify environment configuration is consistent |

### Edge Cases

Handle token theft by implementing IP validation and token revocation endpoints.

# ADR-042: Adoption of GraphQL for API Layer

## Status

Accepted

**Date**: 2023-05-12
**Last Modified**: 2023-05-20

### History

| Date       | Status   | Changes                        | Author     |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| 2023-05-12 | Proposed | Initial draft                  | Jane Smith |
| 2023-05-20 | Accepted | Updated based on team feedback | Jane Smith |

## Context

Our current REST API structure has led to:
1. Significant over-fetching of data for mobile clients
2. Multiple round-trips for complex UI screens
3. Fragmentation of API documentation
4. Difficulty in maintaining consistent versioning

The frontend teams regularly request custom endpoints to optimize data fetching.

## Decision

We will adopt GraphQL as the primary API interface for all new services and
gradually migrate existing REST endpoints to GraphQL resolvers.

## Detailed Approach

1. Create a GraphQL gateway using Apollo Server
2. Define core schema using SDL (Schema Definition Language)
3. Implement resolvers that connect to existing services
4. Deploy alongside existing REST API with a migration path

Auth will be handled using the existing JWT tokens passed as headers.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Enhanced REST with HATEOAS**: Would improve discoverability but not solve the over-fetching problem
2. **OData Protocol**: More complex than needed and less tooling support
3. **JSON API Specification**: Better than basic REST but still limited in query flexibility
4. **gRPC**: Excellent for service-to-service but poor browser support

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clients can request exactly the data they need
- Self-documenting API with introspection
- Strong typing improves development experience
- Reduced network payload for complex queries

### Negative

- Learning curve for teams familiar with REST
- Potential for complex queries that impact performance
- Caching becomes more complex

### Neutral

- Need to manage schema evolution carefully
- Testing strategy will need to adapt

## Implementation Plan

1. Create proof of concept with one bounded context (User domain)
2. Develop tooling for schema validation and testing
3. Train teams on GraphQL patterns
4. Incrementally expand to other domains

### Technical Debt

The existing REST endpoints will need maintenance during transition, creating
temporary duplication of data access logic.
