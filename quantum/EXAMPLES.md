# Quantum Language Examples

This document provides practical examples of Quantum language usage, demonstrating compression techniques and their applications. Each example shows both the expanded knowledge representation and its compressed Quantum form.

## Basic Entity and Relationship Example

### Expanded Form

```
The concept of knowledge representation is a fundamental principle in artificial intelligence.
It encompasses methods for structuring information in formats that can be efficiently processed.
Knowledge representation connects to knowledge graphs, which organize information in networked structures.
The field of ontology provides theoretical foundations for knowledge representation.
```

### Compressed Quantum Form

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}

@concept{knowledge_representation}:p{domain:"ai",type:"principle",importance:"fundamental"}
@concept{knowledge_representation}:p{definition:"methods for structuring information in processable formats"}
@concept{knowledge_graph}:p{type:"implementation",structure:"networked"}
@concept{ontology}:p{role:"theoretical_foundation"}

@knowledge_representation->@knowledge_graph:p{relationship:"implementation"}
@ontology->@knowledge_representation:p{relationship:"provides_foundation"}
```

### Further Compressed Form

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}

@c{kr}:p{d:"ai",t:"principle",i:"fundamental",def:"methods for structuring information in processable formats"}
@c{kg}:p{t:"implementation",s:"networked"}
@c{ont}:p{r:"theoretical_foundation"}

@kr->@kg:p{r:"implementation"}
@ont->@kr:p{r:"provides_foundation"}
```

## Inheritance-Based Compression Example

### Expanded Form

```
A REST API is a web service interface that follows representational state transfer principles.
It uses HTTP methods and follows statelessness, cacheability, and uniform interface constraints.
A GraphQL API is a web service interface that uses a query language for APIs.
It follows flexible data retrieval, type safety, and introspection principles.
Both REST and GraphQL APIs are web service interfaces with different architectural approaches.
```

### Compressed Quantum Form

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}

@interface{web_service}:p{type:"api",domain:"integration"}

@interface{rest}^web_service:p{
  architecture:"representational_state_transfer",
  uses:"http_methods",
  principles:["statelessness","cacheability","uniform_interface"]
}

@interface{graphql}^web_service:p{
  architecture:"query_language",
  principles:["flexible_data_retrieval","type_safety","introspection"]
}

@rest<->@graphql:p{comparison:"alternative_approaches",commonality:"web_service_interface"}
```

### With Template Compression

```
@quantum:v1{bootstrap}:p{mode:self_expand,recovery:true}

@interface{web_service}:p{type:"api",domain:"integration"}

$template{api_type}{name,architecture,principles}
  @interface{name}^web_service:p{
    architecture:architecture,
    principles:principles
  }
$end

$use{api_type}{
  "rest",
  "representational_state_transfer",
  ["statelessness","cacheability","uniform_interface"]
}

$use{api_type}{
  "graphql",
  "query_language",
  ["flexible_data_retrieval","type_safety","introspection"]
}

@rest<->@graphql:p{comparison:"alternative_approaches"}
```

## Quantum Partitioning Example

### Expanded Form

```
The authentication system includes:
- User credentials management
- Authentication protocols (OAuth, JWT, SAML)
- Session handling
- Password policies

The authorization system includes:
- Role definitions
- Permission assignments
- Access control rules
- Privilege management

Both systems are part of the security domain but serve different purposes.

Different contexts require different boundaries:
- For developers: focus on implementation details
- For administrators: focus on configuration options
- For auditors: focus on security compliance aspects
- For users: focus on login experience
```

## Compile a Complete Knowledge Domain

This example shows how a complete knowledge domain (Agile Development Methodology) would be compressed using Quantum language.

### Expanded Form (Summary)

```
Agile Software Development Methodology:

Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, 
customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software. It emerged as a response 
to traditional waterfall methodologies.

Core Values (from Agile Manifesto):
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Key Frameworks:
- Scrum: Organized around sprints with specific roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team)
- Kanban: Visual workflow management focused on limiting work in progress
- XP (Extreme Programming): Technical practices like pair programming and TDD
- Lean: Minimizing waste and maximizing value

Common Practices:
- Daily stand-up meetings
- User stories for requirements
- Continuous integration/delivery
- Retrospectives for process improvement
- Iterative development cycles

Benefits:
- Faster delivery of working features
- Better alignment with customer needs
- Improved team collaboration
- Ability to adapt to changing requirements
- Earlier identification of issues
