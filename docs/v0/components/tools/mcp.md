# MCP Integration

::: info Coming Soon
This documentation is currently in development. The MCP Integration module will provide seamless integration with the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.
:::

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration enables Atlas agents to leverage a wide ecosystem of tools and capabilities through a standardized interface. This integration allows agents to interact with external systems, execute specialized operations, and extend their capabilities beyond what's available in the core Atlas framework.

## Planned Features

- **MCP Adapter**: Bridge between Atlas tool system and MCP standard
- **Tool Conversion**: Automatic conversion between Atlas and MCP tool formats
- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic discovery of available MCP tools
- **Permission Management**: Fine-grained control over tool access
- **Execution Handling**: Seamless execution of MCP tools with appropriate error handling

## Architecture

The MCP integration will consist of several key components:

- **MCP Adapter**: Core integration layer
- **MCP Converter**: Handles format conversions
- **MCP Registry**: Manages tool registration and discovery
- **MCP Client**: Handles execution of external MCP tools

## Implementation Timeline

Implementation of the MCP integration is planned for the next development phase. The initial focus will be on the core adapter and basic tool conversion functionality, followed by more advanced features like dynamic discovery and specialized tool integrations.
