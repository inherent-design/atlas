Algorithmic approach for cutting out the middle-man in GPU-based content and AI-usage.

## Introduction

There are certain pieces of specialized software designed to run on the GPU.

Academically and professionally, we use them as compute shaders to massively perform small/simple but massively parallel (happening at the same time) tasks -- like pellets firing out of a shotgun.

Other times, (sometimes also academically and professionally) you encounter them as shader programs, transforming raw data into complex visual outputs. Water. Rain. Light. Sand. Snow.

> And so much more.

Present-day LLM training and inference is the work of discovering domains of understanding naturally through applied reasoning. Algorithmic expressions of relation. Vectorized impressions of training data given shape, gravity. A lot of the work, as has been discovered, benefits greatly from these massively parallelized behemoths of specialized computing.

> GPU != CPU

Today, for no particular reason at all, we'll be attempting to extend the traditional 3D, GL rendering pipeline by allowing training and inference to happen to data on the GPU, at scale.

## What in the World?

<!-- frontier techniques -->

<!-- h3: how LLMs work, really, on die and chips -->

<!-- h3: how LLMs work, really, on pen and paper -->

<!-- what this means for the frontier techniques, and the space yet unmapped -->

## Hm... okay, what then?

<!--

some insights:

- reading per frame 3D buffer data is like trying to wire a human up to a PCIe slot and read every possible cycle:
  - issue: the bandwidth difference between what a "human" is capable of and what even the most modern, current super computers can accomplish is laughable compared to current neural network densities -- auxiliary, human nervous systems posses more neurons and process more sensory stimuli
- the brain takes many shortcuts:
  - cyclic learning, making -- sleep is a facilitator of deep learning
  - various layers of processes operate different functions, passing information through APIs
    - yes, pigeon-holing occurs, but its mostly just a difference in perspective
  - auxiliary functions (partial systems: heart has its own mini-nervous system, specialized functions: fight-flight-fawn-freeze show complex responses and decision making through quick processing of deep information across many levels, but the body is a system always querying itself on how to perform next -- homeostasis, equilibrium)
  - perception is key, attention is key
  - i'm tired, i can't think how i'm human right now man
- algorithmic approaches exist and can be developed to understand scale, perspective, boundary shifts
