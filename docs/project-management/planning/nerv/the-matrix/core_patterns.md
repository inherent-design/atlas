# Core Architectural Patterns

This document outlines the core architectural patterns that form the foundation of the NERV/Matrix architecture.

## Reactive Event Mesh

The Reactive Event Mesh forms the "nervous system" of Atlas, allowing components to communicate without direct coupling.

### Concept

Rather than connecting components through direct method calls, the event mesh creates a decentralized communication layer where:

1. Components emit events without knowledge of subscribers
2. Components subscribe to events without knowledge of publishers
3. Events can be observed, filtered, transformed, and composed

### Benefits for Atlas

- **Decoupling**: Components can evolve independently
- **Observability**: Events can be logged, analyzed, and replayed
- **Extensibility**: New components can integrate by subscribing to existing events
- **Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation with simulated events

## Temporal Versioning

Temporal versioning treats every state change as immutable, creating a timeline of system states rather than mutations.

### Concept

Instead of modifying objects in place, each change creates a new version with:

1. A unique identifier
2. The delta from the previous version
3. Metadata about the cause of the change
4. Temporal relationship to other versions

### Benefits for Atlas

- **Time Travel**: Inspect and revert to any previous system state
- **Auditing**: Every change is documented with its cause
- **Analysis**: Track how state evolves over time
- **Concurrency**: Simplifies concurrent operations by avoiding shared mutable state

## Perspective Shifting

Perspective shifting allows components to adapt their abstraction level dynamically based on the observer's needs.

### Concept

Components provide multiple interfaces or views based on:

1. The observer's role or permissions
2. The required level of detail
3. The current context or operation
4. The stage in the processing pipeline

### Benefits for Atlas

- **Simplified Interfaces**: Present only relevant information for each use case
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually as needed
- **Adaptable Views**: Transform data based on context
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep raw data separate from presentation logic

## State Projection

State projection stores minimal deltas and projection functions rather than complete states.

### Concept

Instead of storing the full state at each change:

1. Store the initial state and subsequent changes (deltas)
2. Apply projection functions to construct any desired view of the state
3. Allow different projections for different use cases

### Benefits for Atlas

- **Efficiency**: Store only the changes, not redundant state copies
- **Flexibility**: Generate different views from the same history
- **Analysis**: Understand how specific changes impact the final state
- **Space Efficiency**: Minimal storage requirements for historical states

## Effect Systems

Effect systems make side effects explicit and trackable, originally from functional programming.

### Concept

Instead of allowing implicit side effects, an effect system:

1. Explicitly declares what effects an operation might have
2. Tracks effects through the call stack
3. Allows controlled composition of effectful operations
4. Enables reasoning about side effects statically

### Benefits for Atlas

- **Transparency**: Clear documentation of what operations do
- **Predictability**: Easier reasoning about program behavior
- **Testability**: Side effects can be mocked or verified
- **Composition**: Complex operations from simple ones with controlled effects

## Quantum Partitioning

Quantum partitioning breaks operations into parallelizable units that maintain relationships.

### Concept

Unlike traditional parallel programming models, quantum partitioning:

1. Divides work into "quantum units" with explicit dependencies
2. Schedules execution dynamically based on runtime conditions
3. Maintains cross-cutting relationships between units
4. Allows both sequential and parallel composition

The name comes from the concept of quantum superposition - units exist in a state of potential execution until their dependencies are resolved.

### Benefits for Atlas

- **Concurrency**: Automatic parallelism without explicit thread management
- **Declarative**: Express relationships without imperative scheduling
- **Adaptability**: Scales from single-threaded to many-core execution
- **Safety**: Automatically detects dependency cycles
