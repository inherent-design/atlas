# NERV: Core Services Architecture

This document outlines the visionary architecture for Atlas's core services - a meta-framework that provides deep introspection, composition, and dynamic reconfiguration capabilities. While some elements will be implemented in the current development cycle, others represent future possibilities that align with the long-term vision.

## Architectural Philosophy

The NERV architecture embraces principles that allow patterns to emerge organically through interaction rather than rigid predefinition.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Emergence Over Prescription**: Let design emerge from interaction patterns rather than imposing structure
2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build complex behaviors by combining simple ones
3. **Contextual Immutability**: Use immutability where it matters most, allowing pragmatic mutability elsewhere
4. **Introspection First**: All components should be observable and self-describing
5. **Temporal Awareness**: Maintain history and enable time travel for debugging
6. **Adaptive Perspectives**: Different views of the same data for different contexts
7. **Cross-Cutting Integration**: Recognize when concerns span components and handle them naturally
8. **Dependency Discovery**: Components discover what they need rather than being explicitly wired

### Emergent Design Approach

NERV embraces a philosophy where architecture emerges from practical needs rather than theoretical perfection:

1. **Continuous Adaptation**: Components evolve based on real-world usage patterns
2. **Pattern Blurring**: Embrace blurred boundaries between patterns when it creates more natural interactions
3. **Heterogeneous Integration**: Different parts of the system can follow different patterns based on their needs
4. **Context-Sensitive Implementation**: The same component may behave differently in different contexts
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Start with the simplest viable approach and add sophistication only when needed

## Architectural Layers

The NERV architecture is organized into a quantum-inspired layered system:

| Layer                                    | Description                      | Examples                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Primitives](primitives/index.md)        | Foundational design patterns     | Observer, Command, Strategy                   |
| [Patterns](patterns/index.md)            | Core architectural patterns      | Reactive Event Mesh, Temporal Versioning      |
| [Components](#component-implementations) | Concrete pattern implementations | EventBus, TemporalStore                       |
| [Composite Systems](#composite-systems)  | Combinations of components       | Event-Driven Architecture, Parallel Workflows |

## Implementation Libraries: A Pragmatic Toolkit

NERV takes a pragmatic approach to library integration, recognizing that real-world implementation needs often transcend rigid patterns. These libraries form a toolkit rather than a strict framework:

| Implementation Area    | Primary Library                                                         | Purpose                                   | Usage Philosophy                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event Communication    | [Blinker](https://pythonhosted.org/blinker/)                            | Fast in-process signal/event dispatching  | Use for loose coupling; consider direct callbacks for tight coupling                    |
| Temporal Persistence   | [Eventsourcing](https://eventsourcing.readthedocs.io/)                  | Event-based state persistence and history | Apply selectively to state that benefits from temporal tracking                         |
| Data Transformation    | [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/)                      | Schema-based data transformation          | Use where formal schema validation adds value; consider simpler approaches elsewhere    |
| Immutable State        | [Pyrsistent](https://pyrsistent.readthedocs.io/)                        | Immutable data structures with transforms | Apply to critical state paths; allow mutable structures when performance matters        |
| Effect Management      | [Effect](https://github.com/python-effect/effect)                       | Explicit side effect tracking             | Use for complex side effects; allow direct effects for simple cases                     |
| Parallel Execution     | [TaskMap](https://github.com/dask/taskmap)                              | Dependency-based parallel execution       | Apply where parallelism complexity justifies it; use simpler concurrency elsewhere      |
| Data Synchronization   | [DiffSync](https://github.com/networktocode/diffsync)                   | Data comparison and synchronization       | Use for complex bi-directional sync; consider simpler approaches for one-way sync       |
| Cross-Cutting Concerns | [AspectLib](https://github.com/src-d/python-aspectl)                    | Aspect-oriented programming capabilities  | Apply selectively where true cross-cutting exists; prefer explicit approaches otherwise |
| Component Wiring       | [Dependency Injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/) | Component wiring and lifecycle management | Use for complex dependency graphs; allow direct instantiation for simpler cases         |

These libraries serve as core implementation tools, but NERV's inherent design approach encourages:

1. **Adaptive Library Usage**: Use libraries where they add value, not where they add complexity
2. **Pragmatic Mixing**: Mix different approaches based on context rather than adhering to a single pattern
3. **Emergent Integration**: Let integration patterns emerge from actual usage rather than theoretical models
4. **Progressive Adoption**: Start with minimal library usage and increase sophistication as needs demonstrate

## Design Patterns

The NERV architecture is implemented through these core design patterns:

## Performance Considerations

When implementing NERV components, consider these performance aspects:

1. **EventBus with Blinker**
   - Use weak references to prevent memory leaks: `signal.connect(handler, weak=True)`
   - Implement partitioned signals for high-volume event types
   - Optimize middleware chains for frequently triggered events

2. **Effect Management with Effect**
   - Group similar effects to reduce handler overhead
   - Use selective effect execution based on context
   - Implement batched effect dispatching with `parallel_all()`

3. **TemporalStore with Eventsourcing**
   - Implement state snapshots at strategic intervals
   - Use selective history loading for large event streams
   - Optimize event serialization for storage efficiency

4. **StateProjector with Pyrsistent**

   - Cache computed projections for frequently accessed views

5. **Parallel Execution with TaskMap**
   - Adapt task granularity to hardware capabilities
   - Implement dynamic worker pool sizing
   - Use bounded queues to prevent resource exhaustion

6. **PerspectiveAware with Marshmallow**
   - Cache schema instances and transformations
   - Use partial serialization for large data structures

   - Add effect tracking with Effect

3. **Phase 3**: Perspective and Synchronization
   - Implement PerspectiveAware with Marshmallow
   - Create DiffSynchronizer with DiffSync
   - Integrate perspectives with state projections

4. **Phase 4**: Parallelism and Integration
   - Implement QuantumPartitioner with TaskMap

## Type System

NERV implements a comprehensive type system that ensures correctness while providing flexibility:

| Type Category  | Key Types                                                                        | Purpose                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Type Variables | `T`, `S`, `R`, `E`, `V`, `P`, `K`                                                | Generic type parameters for polymorphic components |
| Entity Types   | `EntityId`, `VersionId`, `ResourceId`, `EventId`                                 | Strong typing for identity references              |
| Enumerations   | `EventType`, `EffectType`, `LifecycleState`                                      | Typed constants for state representation           |
| Data Classes   | `Event`, `Effect`, `Resource`, `VersionedState`                                  | Core data structures with typed fields             |
| Protocols      | `Observable`, `Versioned`, `Projectable`, `Effectful`, `QuantumUnit`, `Boundary` | Interface definitions for pattern implementations  |

## Natural Integration Zones

NERV recognizes that real systems have natural integration points where different concerns blend together organically. Rather than forcing strict boundaries between patterns, NERV identifies these natural integration zones:

### State-Event Continuum

Where state management (Pyrsistent) and event systems (Blinker) blend naturally:

- Events become state transitions and state transitions produce events
- The boundary between when to use events versus state updates emerges from usage context
- Performance optimizations may blur the line between immutable and mutable approaches

### Execution-Dependency Fabric

Where task execution (TaskMap) and component wiring (Dependency Injector) naturally interweave:

- Component dependencies and task dependencies form a unified execution graph
- Task creation and component instantiation blend at the boundaries
- Runtime discovery influences both dependency resolution and execution planning

### Perspective-Synchronization Mesh

Where data transformation (Marshmallow) and data synchronization (DiffSync) naturally overlap:

- Data projections and synchronization represent two views of the same concern
- Schema definitions serve dual purposes for validation and diffing
- Transformation and reconciliation form a natural feedback loop

### Effect-Aspect Continuum

Where side effect management (Effect) and cross-cutting concerns (AspectLib) naturally merge:

- Side effects often represent cross-cutting concerns
- Aspects can be viewed as pre/post effect handlers
- Both address the challenge of making implicit behavior explicit

## Future Vision: Organic Evolution

NERV will evolve naturally based on actual usage patterns, embracing:

- **Self-Organizing Systems**: Components and patterns that emerge and refactor based on real-world usage
- **Contextual Sophistication**: Different levels of sophistication applied where they add value
- **Blended Boundaries**: Natural integration zones where strict pattern separation is counterproductive
- **Progressive Enhanceability**: Systems that start simple but can evolve incrementally toward sophistication
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Appropriate complexity that matches the problem domain's natural complexity

By embracing emergent design over rigid architecture, NERV creates systems that feel natural to use and extend, adapting organically to changing requirements while maintaining core reliability and flexibility.
