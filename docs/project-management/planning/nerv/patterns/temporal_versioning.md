# Temporal Versioning

## Overview

Temporal Versioning treats every state change as immutable, creating a timeline of system states rather than mutations. It enables time travel, auditing, and historical analysis by maintaining a complete version history.

## Key Concepts

- **Version ID**: Unique identifier for each version
- **Delta Changes**: Only store what changed between versions
- **State Timeline**: Linear or branching history of states
- **Commit**: The act of creating a new version
- **Rollback**: Reverting to a previous version

## Benefits

- **Time Travel**: Inspect and revert to any previous system state
- **Auditing**: Every change is documented with its cause
- **Analysis**: Track how state evolves over time
- **Concurrency**: Simplifies concurrent operations with immutable states
- **Debugging**: Examine system state at any historical point

## Implementation Considerations

- **Storage Efficiency**: Consider delta storage vs. full state copies
- **Branching Strategy**: Support for linear history vs. branched history
- **Performance Impact**: Balance history tracking with runtime performance
- **Garbage Collection**: Policy for pruning old versions
- **Referential Integrity**: Handling references between versioned objects

## Core Interfaces

```
Versioned[S]
├── get_current_version_id() -> VersionId
├── get_version(version_id) -> S
├── commit(state, description) -> VersionId
└── get_history() -> List[VersionInfo]
```

## Pattern Variations

### Linear History

Simple version chain where each version has one parent and one child. Best for straightforward history tracking.

### Branched History

Tree-like structure where versions can have multiple children. Useful for exploring alternative paths or concurrent editing.

### Git-like Model

Sophisticated versioning with merge capability, allowing concurrent branches to be combined.

## Integration with Other Patterns

- **Reactive Event Mesh**: Events can trigger version creation
- **Perspective Shifting**: Different views of version history
- **State Projection**: Projections built from version history
- **Effect System**: Version changes can be modeled as effects
