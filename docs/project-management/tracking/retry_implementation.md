# Robust Retry Mechanism Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns in Atlas.

## Overview

We've implemented a sophisticated retry system that makes LLM provider API calls more resilient to transient failures. The implementation includes:

1. **Core retry utilities**: Generic retry functionality with exponential backoff and jitter
2. **Circuit breaker pattern**: Prevents cascading failures by temporarily disabling requests to failing services
3. **Provider integration**: Integration of retry mechanism into all LLM providers
4. **Improved error handling**: Standardized error handling across all providers
5. **Documentation and examples**: Comprehensive guides and examples for developers

## Components Implemented

### Core Retry Utilities

- **RetryConfig class**: Configurable retry parameters including max retries, delays, and backoff factors
- **Exponential backoff algorithm**: Increases delays between retry attempts
- **Jitter mechanism**: Prevents thundering herd problems in distributed systems
- **Retryable error classification**: Smart identification of which errors should be retried

File: `atlas/core/retry.py`

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

- **CircuitBreaker class**: Tracks failure rates and temporarily disables requests to failing services
- **State transitions**: CLOSED (normal) → OPEN (failing) → HALF-OPEN (testing) → CLOSED (recovered)
- **Configurable parameters**: Failure threshold, recovery timeout, and test request limits

File: `atlas/core/retry.py`

### Provider Integration

- **Base provider enhancement**: Added retry capabilities to the ModelProvider base class
- **Provider-specific integration**: Updated all provider implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- **Stream handling**: Applied retry mechanism to both regular and streaming API calls
- **Configuration options**: Added retry configuration options to provider initialization

Files:
- `atlas/models/base.py`
- `atlas/models/openai.py`
- `atlas/models/anthropic.py`
- `atlas/models/ollama.py`

### Error Handling Improvements

- **RateLimitError class**: New specialized error type for rate limiting scenarios
- **Error transformation**: Standardized error handling across providers
- **Detailed error information**: Added retry-related metadata to error objects
- **Consistent API**: Unified error handling interface across all providers

Files:
- `atlas/core/errors.py`
- Provider implementation files

### Documentation and Examples

- **Developer guide**: Comprehensive guide on using the retry mechanism
- **Example code**: Working example showing retry configuration and usage
- **Best practices**: Guidance on optimal retry settings for different scenarios

Files:
- `docs/guides/robust_retry.md`
- `examples/robust_retry_example.py`

## Implementation Details

### Retry Algorithm

The retry mechanism uses an exponential backoff algorithm with jitter:

```python
delay = initial_delay * (backoff_factor ** retry_count)
delay = min(delay, max_delay)
jitter = delay * jitter_factor * random.random()
delay = delay + jitter
```

### Circuit Breaker States

The circuit breaker has three states:
1. **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests allowed
2. **OPEN**: Service failing, requests blocked
3. **HALF-OPEN**: Testing recovery, limited requests allowed

### Provider Integration

All providers now include retry and circuit breaker capabilities:

```python
def generate(self, request):
    return self.safe_execute_with_retry(
        make_api_call,
        error_handler=api_error_handler,
    )
```

## Migration Notes

Existing code using Atlas providers will automatically benefit from the retry mechanism with default settings. For customization, developers should use the new retry parameters when initializing providers:

```python
provider = OpenAIProvider(
    retry_config=RetryConfig(max_retries=3),
    circuit_breaker=CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=5),
)
```

## Testing Status

The implementation includes unit tests for the core retry mechanism. However, the existing provider tests need updates to work with the new retry implementation, as they were designed for the previous direct error handling approach.

## Next Steps

1. Update provider tests to work with the retry mechanism
2. Implement provider-specific optimizations for retry behavior
3. Add telemetry for retry attempts and circuit breaker states
4. Consider implementing client-side rate limiting to prevent hitting API limits
