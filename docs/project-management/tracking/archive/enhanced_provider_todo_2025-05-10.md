from typing import Dict, List, Set, Optional, Union, Type, Any
from enum import IntEnum

from atlas.providers.base import BaseProvider
from atlas.providers.capabilities import CapabilityStrength

class ProviderRegistry:
    """Central registry for provider, model, and capability information."""

    def __init__(self):
        # Core data structures
        self._providers: Dict[str, Type[BaseProvider]] = {}  # name -> Provider class
        self._provider_models: Dict[str, List[str]] = {}  # provider_name -> list of models
        self._model_capabilities: Dict[str, Dict[str, CapabilityStrength]] = {}  # model_name -> {capability -> strength}
        self._capability_models: Dict[str, Set[str]] = {}  # capability -> set of models
        self._model_providers: Dict[str, str] = {}  # model_name -> provider_name

    def register_provider(self, name: str, provider_class: Type[BaseProvider], models: List[str] = None):
        """Register a provider and its supported models."""
        self._providers[name] = provider_class
        if models:
            self._provider_models[name] = models
            for model in models:
                self._model_providers[model] = name

        return self  # Enable chaining

    # Additional methods...
```

### ProviderGroup

```python
# atlas/providers/group.py
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Callable, Optional
import logging

from atlas.providers.base import BaseProvider
from atlas.providers.capabilities import get_capabilities_for_task, detect_task_type_from_prompt

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProviderSelectionStrategy:
    """Strategy for selecting providers from a group."""

    @staticmethod
    def failover(providers: List[BaseProvider], context: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> List[BaseProvider]:
        """Returns providers in order, for failover purposes."""
        return providers

    # Additional strategies...

class ProviderGroup(BaseProvider):
    """A provider that encapsulates multiple providers with fallback capabilities."""

    def __init__(
        self,
        providers: List[BaseProvider],
        selection_strategy: Callable = ProviderSelectionStrategy.failover,
        name: str = "provider_group",
    ):
        """Initialize a provider group with a list of providers."""
        if not providers:
            raise ValueError("ProviderGroup requires at least one provider")

        self.providers = providers
        self.selection_strategy = selection_strategy
        self._name = name
        self._health_status = {provider: True for provider in providers}
        self._context = {}  # Context for selection strategy

    # Additional methods...
```
