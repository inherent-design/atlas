::: danger CLEAN BREAK ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION
We are implementing a clean break architecture approach that prioritizes architectural clarity, consistent patterns, and future extensibility. This involves a phased redesign of core components around services, breaking backward compatibility when necessary. We will implement service-enabled versions of providers, agents, and knowledge systems that work alongside existing implementations until we've validated the new architecture.
:::

## Current Sprint Focus

::: warning Revised Priority Requirements
1. Core Services Integration (Critical) ✅
   - Core service interfaces and schemas implemented
   - Service registry implementation completed
   - Event system with middleware functionality working
   - Buffer system with flow control implemented
   - State container with transitions operational
   - Command pattern system fully implemented
   - Fixed all implementation issues and tests passing

2. Provider System Redesign (Critical)
   - Complete base provider with service integration
   - Implement provider command pattern
   - Create service-enabled implementations for all providers

3. Schema-Validated Interfaces (Critical)
   - Ensure all components have schema validation
   - Validate all inter-component communication
   - Create comprehensive validation test suite

## Development Tools Best Practices

With enhanced pyproject.toml configuration, we now have simplified developer commands:

```bash
# Testing with pytest (includes coverage automatically)
uv run pytest                              # Run all tests with coverage
uv run pytest atlas/tests/core/services/  # Run specific test modules with coverage

# Code quality tools
uv run mypy atlas                         # Type check the project
uv run ruff check .                       # Lint the project
uv run ruff format .                      # Format the project

# Pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files         # Run all pre-commit hooks
```

The project configuration has been optimized so that `uv run pytest` automatically includes coverage reporting with the right settings, and all tools can be run directly without the `python -m` prefix.
