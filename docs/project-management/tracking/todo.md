    def __init__(self, max_size=1000, ttl_seconds=3600):
        """Initialize cache with size and time-to-live limits."""
        self.cache = {}  # query_hash -> {result, timestamp}
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.ttl_seconds = ttl_seconds
        
    def get(self, query, filter=None):
        """Get cached result for query if exists and valid."""
        cache_key = self._create_key(query, filter)
        if cache_key in self.cache:
            entry = self.cache[cache_key]
            if self._is_valid(entry["timestamp"]):
                return entry["result"]
        return None
    
    def put(self, query, result, filter=None):
        """Store result in cache."""
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            self._evict_oldest()
        
        cache_key = self._create_key(query, filter)
        self.cache[cache_key] = {
            "result": result,
            "timestamp": time.time()
        }
    
    def invalidate(self, query=None, filter=None):
        """Invalidate specific entry or all entries matching pattern."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Workflow & Multi-Agent Orchestration

Enhancing communication and coordination between agents:

```python
class StructuredMessage:
    """Structured message format for agent communication."""
    
    def __init__(self, content, metadata=None, task_id=None):
        self.content = content
        self.metadata = metadata or {}
        self.task_id = task_id or str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.timestamp = time.time()
    
    def to_dict(self):
        """Convert to dictionary for serialization."""
        return {
            "content": self.content,
            "metadata": self.metadata,
            "task_id": self.task_id,
            "timestamp": self.timestamp
        }
```

### 3. Provider Optimization

Improving provider management for better performance and reliability:

```python
class ProviderPool:
    """Connection pool for model providers."""
    
    def __init__(self, provider_class, max_connections=5, **kwargs):
        self.provider_class = provider_class
        self.max_connections = max_connections
        self.provider_args = kwargs
        self.connections = []
        self.in_use = set()
        self.lock = threading.RLock()
    
    def get_connection(self):
        """Get an available connection or create a new one."""
        with self.lock:
            # Implementation details...
    
    def release_connection(self, connection):
        """Return a connection to the pool."""

## Development Principles

1. **Clean Break Philosophy**: Prioritize building high-quality, robust APIs over maintaining backward compatibility with legacy code.
2. **Parallel Development**: Build new implementations alongside existing code until ready for complete cutover.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Create comprehensive tests alongside or before implementation.
4. **Complete Documentation**: Provide thorough documentation for all new components with clear examples.
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Implement consistent, informative error handling throughout all components.
6. **Type Safety**: Use comprehensive type hints and validation for better code quality and reliability.
7. **Consistent Environment Configuration**: Maintain a clear precedence model for configuration (CLI args > env vars > defaults).
8. **Modular Design**: Create loosely coupled components that can be used independently.
9. **Documentation-Driven Implementation**: Use documentation to guide implementation while resolving any discrepancies:
   - Start with thoroughly documenting the expected behavior and interfaces
   - When discrepancies arise between documentation and implementation needs:
     - Favor the approach that provides better API design, performance, and maintainability
     - Update documentation to match implementation decisions when technical requirements necessitate changes
     - Preserve the original design intent while adapting to technical realities
   - Keep both implementation and documentation in sync throughout development
