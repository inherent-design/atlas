## Current Sprint Focus: Provider & Agent System Integration

::: warning Priority Requirements
Our focus for this sprint is entirely on:
1. Finalizing the provider architecture, including complex stream controls
2. Tightly integrating the agent system with our new provider system
3. Maintaining a clean break perspective for future developments
:::

::: tip Component Focus
- Providers: Streaming infrastructure, lifecycle management
- Agents: Controller-worker improvements, capability integration
- Examples: Updated streaming examples and documentation
:::
