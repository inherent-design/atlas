# Atlas Project TODO

## Project Status and Roadmap

This file tracks active development tasks for Atlas. For the current sprint, we're focused on finalizing the provider architecture and integrating it with the agent system.

## Current Sprint Focus: Provider & Agent System Integration

Our focus for this sprint is entirely on:
1. Finalizing the provider architecture, including complex stream controls
2. Tightly integrating the agent system with our new provider system
3. Maintaining a clean break perspective for future developments

## Provider System Enhancement Tasks

### 1. Enhanced Streaming Infrastructure

- [ ] Update BaseStreamHandler in providers/base.py
  - [ ] Design a standardized StreamControl interface
  - [ ] Add stream control capabilities (pause, resume, cancel)
  - [ ] Implement buffering mechanisms for stream manipulation
  - [ ] Add performance metrics tracking during streaming
  - [ ] Implement proper resource cleanup for all streams
  - [ ] Ensure consistent error handling across providers

- [ ] Update provider implementations
  - [ ] Update streaming in AnthropicProvider for compatibility
  - [ ] Update streaming in OpenAIProvider for compatibility
  - [ ] Update streaming in OllamaProvider for compatibility
  - [ ] Update MockProvider to simulate streaming controls
  - [ ] Verify streaming token accounting across all providers

- [ ] Enhance ProviderGroup streaming capabilities
  - [ ] Improve streaming fallback between providers
  - [ ] Add reliability tracking during streaming
  - [ ] Implement adaptive provider selection during streaming
  - [ ] Add token budget enforcement during streaming

**Files to Modify:**
- `atlas/providers/base.py`: Add StreamControl interface and enhanced base handlers
- `atlas/providers/group.py`: Enhance stream handling with fallback mechanisms
- `atlas/providers/anthropic.py`: Update streaming implementation with new interface
- `atlas/providers/openai.py`: Update streaming implementation with new interface
- `atlas/providers/ollama.py`: Update streaming implementation with new interface
- `atlas/providers/mock.py`: Update mock streaming for testing

### 2. Provider Integration Optimization

- [ ] Create provider lifecycle management
  - [ ] Add connection pooling for providers
  - [ ] Implement connection reuse mechanisms
  - [ ] Add health checking and circuit breaking
  - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of resources

- [ ] Improve provider error handling
  - [ ] Add detailed error categorization
  - [ ] Create common error types across providers
  - [ ] Implement structured error responses
  - [ ] Add retry policies based on error types

**Files to Modify:**
- `atlas/providers/base.py`: Add enhanced error handling
- `atlas/core/errors.py`: Add provider-specific error types
- `atlas/providers/capabilities.py`: Add reliability metadata

## Agent System Integration Tasks

### 1. Agent-Provider Integration

- [ ] Enhance agent-provider interface
  - [ ] Create a clean agent-provider interface protocol
  - [ ] Add provider capability utilization in agents
  - [ ] Improve agent configuration with provider options
  - [ ] Add streaming controls to agent interfaces

- [ ] Update agent implementations
  - [ ] Ensure TaskAwareAgent uses provider capabilities optimally
  - [ ] Update controller-worker communication for streaming
  - [ ] Add provider selection feedback mechanisms
  - [ ] Implement provider performance tracking

**Files to Modify:**
- `atlas/agents/base.py`: Enhance provider integration
- `atlas/agents/specialized/task_aware_agent.py`: Optimize provider capability usage
- `atlas/agents/controller.py`: Update with enhanced provider patterns
- `atlas/agents/worker.py`: Add provider capability awareness

### 2. Example Development

- [ ] Create enhanced streaming example
  - [ ] Demonstrate stream control capabilities
  - [ ] Show provider fallback during streaming
  - [ ] Illustrate streaming pause/resume functionality
  - [ ] Add streaming with multi-provider selection

- [ ] Update existing examples
  - [ ] Ensure all examples follow consistent patterns
  - [ ] Verify examples work with the latest provider system
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling in examples
  - [ ] Update documentation in examples

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Create: `examples/07_enhanced_streaming.py`: New streaming controls example
- Update: `examples/08_multi_agent_providers.py`: Update with latest patterns
- Update: Other examples as needed for consistency

## Implementation Roadmap

This focused sprint prioritizes the provider and agent system integration:

1. First, create the enhanced streaming infrastructure in the provider system
2. Then, improve the provider integration with robust error handling and lifecycle management
3. Next, enhance the agent-provider interface for optimal integration
4. Finally, create examples demonstrating these enhancements

After this sprint, we will shift focus to:
1. Knowledge system enhancements with hybrid retrieval
2. Tool system implementation
3. Multi-agent workflow systems

## Resource Allocation

- Primary: Provider system enhancements
- Secondary: Agent system integration
- On Hold: Knowledge system, tool system, and other components
