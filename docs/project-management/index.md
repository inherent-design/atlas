## Document Standards

When creating or updating project management documents:

3. Ensure consistency across related documents
4. Archive superseded documents rather than deleting them
5. Update status indicators in tracking documents
6. Adhere to the [documentation standards](../contributing/documentation-standards.md) and [style guide](../contributing/style-guide.md)
