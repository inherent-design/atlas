## Document Standards

When creating or updating project management documents:

1. Follow the established templates and formatting
2. Maintain alignment with our June 30, 2025 completion target
3. Ensure consistency across related documents
4. Archive superseded documents rather than deleting them
5. Update status indicators in tracking documents
6. Adhere to the [documentation guide](../contributing/documentation-guide.md) and [implementation guide](../contributing/implementation-guide.md)
