## Atlas

Atlas is a comprehensive meta-framework for knowledge representation, documentation, and adaptive guidance systems. It integrates advanced graph-based knowledge structures with a controller-worker architecture and LangGraph implementation.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Controller-worker pattern for parallel processing and specialization
- **LangGraph Integration**: Graph-based workflows for complex agent behaviors
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintains context across sessions using ChromaDB vector storage
- **Documentation Indexing**: Automatically processes and indexes documentation with gitignore-aware filtering
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant context based on user queries
- **Consistent Identity**: Maintains the Atlas identity and principles in all interactions

### Documentation Sections
