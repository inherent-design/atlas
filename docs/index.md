## Atlas

Atlas is a comprehensive meta-framework for knowledge representation, documentation, and adaptive guidance systems. It integrates advanced graph-based knowledge structures with a controller-worker architecture and LangGraph implementation.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Controller-worker pattern for parallel processing and specialization
- **LangGraph Integration**: Graph-based workflows for complex agent behaviors
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Maintains context across sessions using ChromaDB vector storage
- **Documentation Indexing**: Automatically processes and indexes documentation with gitignore-aware filtering
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Retrieves relevant context based on user queries
- **Consistent Identity**: Maintains the Atlas identity and principles in all interactions

### Documentation Sections

- **[MVP Strategy](MVP_STRATEGY.md)**: Implementation strategy for the minimum viable product
- **[Implementation Plan](TODO.md)**: Detailed roadmap and task checklist
- **[Testing Guide](TESTING.md)**: Comprehensive testing approach and patterns
- **[Environment Variables](ENV_VARIABLES.md)**: Configuration options via environment variables
- **[Models](MODELS.md)**: Supported language models and capabilities
- **[Model Providers](MODEL_PROVIDERS.md)**: Available model providers and their integration
- **[ChromaDB Viewer](CHROMADB_VIEWER.md)**: Tools for inspecting the vector database
