# Aspect Orientation Pattern

## Overview

The Aspect Orientation pattern provides a structured approach to managing cross-cutting concerns that span multiple components within a system. It enables the separation of these concerns from core business logic, promoting cleaner code structure and better maintainability.

## Key Concepts

- **Aspect**: A modular unit that encapsulates cross-cutting behavior
- **Join Point**: Specific points in program execution where aspects can be applied
- **Pointcut**: Expression that defines which join points to target
- **Advice**: The behavior to execute at specific join points
- **Weaving**: Process of integrating aspects into the main code

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Isolates cross-cutting concerns from business logic
- **Reduced Duplication**: Centralizes behaviors that would otherwise be scattered
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform implementation of system-wide concerns
- **Maintainability**: Changes to cross-cutting concerns can be made in one place
- **Modularity**: Cross-cutting behaviors become reusable modular units

## Implementation Considerations

- **Performance Impact**: Weaving and indirection can introduce overhead
- **Debugging Complexity**: Control flow can be harder to trace
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of aspect-oriented concepts
- **Scope Management**: Carefully define where aspects should apply
- **Aspect Interactions**: Multiple aspects may interact in complex ways

## Implementation with AspectLib

The Aspect Orientation pattern in NERV is implemented using AspectLib, which provides aspect-oriented programming capabilities for Python. AspectLib was chosen for the following reasons:

1. **Simple API**: Straightforward API for defining aspects and advice
2. **Python-native**: Designed specifically for Python applications
3. **Low Overhead**: Minimal runtime performance impact
4. **Flexible Pointcuts**: Expressive pointcut language for precise targeting
5. **Dynamic Weaving**: Support for runtime aspect weaving

### Core AspectLib Components

| Component     | Purpose                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Aspect**    | Base class for defining aspects          |
| **Pointcut**  | Defines where aspects should be applied  |
| **Advice**    | Defines behavior (before, after, around) |
| **Weaver**    | Integrates aspects with application code |
| **JoinPoint** | Represents execution context for advice  |

### Advice Types

AspectLib supports several types of advice:

- **Before**: Executes before the target method
- **After**: Executes after the target method (always executes)
- **After returning**: Executes after successful completion
- **After throwing**: Executes after an exception is thrown
- **Around**: Wraps the target method with complete control

## Pattern Variations

### Static Aspect Weaving

Uses compile-time or load-time weaving for better performance.

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class StaticAspectWeaver:
    """Static aspect weaver that processes classes before runtime."""

    def weave_class(self, cls, aspects):
        """Apply aspects to class at load time."""
        # Process methods and apply aspects
        return modified_cls
```

### Dynamic Aspect Registration

Enables runtime registration and activation of aspects.

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class DynamicAspectRegistry:
    """Registry for dynamic aspect management."""

    def register_aspect(self, aspect, active=True):
        """Register an aspect with optional activation."""
        # Implementation details...

    def activate_aspect(self, aspect_id):
        """Activate a previously registered aspect."""
        # Implementation details...

    def deactivate_aspect(self, aspect_id):
        """Temporarily disable an aspect."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### Hierarchical Aspect Application

Applies aspects at different architectural layers with inheritance.

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class LayeredAspectWeaver:
    """Weaver that applies aspects with layer awareness."""

    def apply_to_layer(self, layer_name, aspects):
        """Apply aspects to all components in a specific layer."""
        # Implementation details...

    def apply_with_inheritance(self, parent_layer, child_layers):
        """Apply parent aspects to child layers with inheritance."""
        # Implementation details...
```

## Common Cross-Cutting Concerns

The Aspect Orientation pattern efficiently addresses these common concerns:

### Logging and Tracing

Capture method execution details across components.

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class LoggingAspect:
    """Aspect for consistent logging across components."""

    @Pointcut("execution(* *.*(..)) and not within(LoggingAspect)")
    def all_methods(self):
        """Match all methods except those in this aspect."""
        pass

    @Advice.before("all_methods")
    def log_entry(self, join_point):
        """Log method entry with parameters."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### Security and Authorization

Enforce access controls consistently throughout the system.

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class SecurityAspect:
    """Aspect for security enforcement."""

    @Pointcut("execution(* *.get_*(..)) and args(id, ..)")
    def access_operations(self):
        """Match getter operations with ID parameter."""
        pass

    @Advice.before("access_operations")
    def check_authorization(self, join_point):
        """Verify authorization before allowing access."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### Performance Monitoring

Track execution times across system components.

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class PerformanceAspect:
    """Aspect for performance monitoring."""

    @Pointcut("execution(* Provider.*(..))")
    def provider_operations(self):
        """Match provider operations for monitoring."""
        pass

    @Advice.around("provider_operations")
    def measure_execution_time(self, join_point):
        """Measure and record execution time."""
        # Implementation details...
```

## Integration with Other NERV Patterns

### Integration with Reactive Event Mesh

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class EventPublishingAspect:
    """Aspect that publishes events for method execution."""

    def __init__(self, event_bus):
        self.event_bus = event_bus

    @Pointcut("execution(* StateProjector.apply_delta(..))")
    def state_changes(self):
        """Match state change operations."""
        pass

    @Advice.after_returning("state_changes")
    def publish_state_changed(self, join_point, result):
        """Publish event after successful state change."""
        self.event_bus.publish(
            EventType.STATE_CHANGED,
            {"delta_id": result, "source": join_point.target.__class__.__name__}
        )
```

### Integration with Effect System

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class EffectHandlingAspect:
    """Aspect that converts side effects to explicit effects."""

    @Pointcut("execution(* *.*(..)) and within(IoOperations)")
    def io_operations(self):
        """Match I/O operations."""
        pass

    @Advice.around("io_operations")
    def convert_to_effect(self, join_point):
        """Convert I/O operations to explicit effects."""
        return effect_monad.of(join_point.proceed).with_effect(
            Effect(EffectType.IO_OPERATION, {
                "operation": join_point.method.__name__,
                "target": join_point.target.__class__.__name__
            })
        )
```

### Integration with Temporal Versioning

```python
# Type definitions only - not full implementation
class VersionTrackingAspect:
    """Aspect that creates version snapshots on significant state changes."""

    def __init__(self, temporal_store):
        self.temporal_store = temporal_store

    @Pointcut("execution(* *.update*(..)) and within(DocumentRepository)")
    def document_updates(self):
        """Match document update operations."""
        pass

    @Advice.after_returning("document_updates")
    def create_version_snapshot(self, join_point, result):
        """Create version snapshot after successful update."""
        self.temporal_store.commit(
            join_point.target.get_current_state(),
            f"Update via {join_point.method.__name__}"
        )
```

## Performance Considerations

When implementing the Aspect Orientation pattern, consider these performance factors:

1. **Selective Application**: Apply aspects only where they provide clear value
2. **Weaving Strategy**: Consider static weaving for critical performance paths
3. **Pointcut Optimization**: Use precise pointcuts to minimize unnecessary advice execution
4. **Caching**: Cache aspect application results when appropriate
5. **Aspect Ordering**: Be mindful of the execution order when multiple aspects apply
