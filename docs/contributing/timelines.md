# Timeline Component Usage Guide

The Atlas documentation uses the [VitePress Markdown Timeline](https://github.com/HanochMa/vitepress-markdown-timeline) component to visualize chronological sequences and processes. This guide outlines when and how to use timeline components effectively.

::: info Implementation Note
The timeline component has been integrated into Atlas documentation using the [vitepress-markdown-timeline](https://github.com/HanochMa/vitepress-markdown-timeline) package. This allows us to create visually appealing timeline presentations using simple Markdown syntax.
:::

## Timeline Component Overview

The timeline component creates visually appealing, sequential representations of:
- Development roadmaps
- Release histories
- Process workflows
- Implementation steps
- Historical evolution

## When to Use Timelines

::: warning Limited Application
Timelines should be used sparingly throughout the documentation as they add significant visual weight and computational overhead.
:::

### Appropriate Use Cases

Timelines are most effective for:

1. **Chronological Development**: Showing project evolution over time
2. **Release Planning**: Visualizing upcoming release schedules
3. **Complex Workflows**: Illustrating multi-step processes with timing considerations
4. **Implementation Phases**: Showing phase transitions with key deliverables
5. **Historical Context**: Providing background on major changes or decisions

### Inappropriate Use Cases

Avoid using timelines for:

1. Simple sequential steps that don't have a strong temporal component
2. Feature comparisons or option descriptions
3. API documentation or method signatures
4. Conceptual explanations that don't follow a timeline
5. Navigation or table of contents replacements

## Timeline Component Syntax

Based on the [vitepress-markdown-timeline](https://github.com/HanochMa/vitepress-markdown-timeline) package, the timeline component has a specific syntax that's important to understand:

::: warning Important Syntax Concept
Each `::: timeline <date/label>` block represents **one event** in a timeline. Sequential timeline blocks automatically combine to form a **single timeline** with multiple events.
:::

The basic syntax for each timeline event is:

```md
::: timeline [Date or Event Label]
- **[Optional Bold Items]**: Important details
- Additional bullet points
- More information
:::
```

### Understanding Timeline Construction

A complete timeline is created by placing multiple `::: timeline` blocks sequentially:

```md
::: timeline 2025-05-15
- **Provider System Finalization**: Enhanced streaming
- Additional implementation details
:::

::: timeline 2025-05-22
- **Agent-Provider Integration**: Streaming controls
- More implementation details
:::
```

This creates **ONE timeline** with **TWO events** (May 15 and May 22).

### Implementation Examples

Here are examples of how to create timelines:

#### Multiple Events in a Single Timeline

```md
::: timeline 2025-05-15
- **Provider System Finalization**: Enhanced streaming with controls
- Provider lifecycle management implementation
- Fallback mechanism improvements
:::

::: timeline 2025-05-22
- **Agent-Provider Integration**: Streaming controls in agents
- Controller-worker communication enhancements
- Provider capability utilization
:::

::: timeline 2025-05-29
- **Knowledge System Enhancements**: Hybrid retrieval
- Advanced chunking strategies
- Metadata filtering features
:::
```

The above code creates ONE timeline with THREE events (May 15, May 22, and May 29).

#### Timeline With Single Date and Multiple Events

For a timeline with a single date but multiple labeled events, use one block:

```md
::: timeline May 2025
- **Week 1**: Provider System Finalization
- Enhanced streaming with controls
- Provider lifecycle management

- **Week 2**: Agent-Provider Integration
- Agent streaming controls
- Provider capability utilization
:::
```

## Design Guidelines

### Content Structure

1. **Entry Conciseness**: Keep entries brief (1-2 sentences per node)
2. **Consistent Format**: Maintain parallel structure across entries
3. **Logical Grouping**: Group timeline entries into logical phases or categories
4. **Chronological Order**: Present entries in sequential order (typically earliest to latest)

### Visual Considerations

1. **Timeline Length**: Limit timelines to 5-12 entries for readability
2. **Visual Balance**: Space primary/highlighted entries throughout the timeline
3. **Content Density**: Avoid overcrowding by keeping entries focused
4. **Mobile Compatibility**: Ensure content is readable on smaller screens

## Timeline Implementation Examples

   - Add a timeline showing architectural evolution
   - Emphasize major design decisions

4. **docs/reference/api.md**
   - Include a timeline of API versions and breaking changes
   - Highlight version transitions

5. **docs/workflows/query.md**
   - Create a timeline visualizing the query processing workflow
   - Show step-by-step data flow

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Context**: Always introduce the timeline with explanatory text
2. **Balance Detail**: Include enough detail to be useful without overwhelming
3. **Consider Accessibility**: Ensure the timeline content makes sense without visual cues
4. **Test Rendering**: Verify timeline displays correctly on different devices
5. **Update Consistently**: Keep timelines updated as project evolves

## Technical Implementation

The timeline component is implemented using the [vitepress-markdown-timeline](https://github.com/HanochMa/vitepress-markdown-timeline) package, which is integrated into the Atlas documentation system.

### Integration Details

The component is integrated in two places:

1. **VitePress Configuration**: In `.vitepress/config.ts` to register the markdown parser:
   ```ts
   import timeline from "vitepress-markdown-timeline";

   export default {
     markdown: {
       config: (md) => {
         md.use(timeline);
       },
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Theme Styles**: In `.vitepress/theme/index.ts` to import the timeline styles:
   ```ts
   import "vitepress-markdown-timeline/dist/theme/index.css";
   ```

### Customizing Timeline Appearance

The timeline's appearance is controlled by the VitePress theme. You can adjust the timeline's colors by modifying the brand color variable in `.vitepress/theme/styles/vars.scss`:

```scss
:root {
  --vp-c-brand: #b575e3; // Modify this to change timeline node colors
}
```

By following these guidelines, you'll create effective timelines that enhance understanding without overwhelming the documentation.
