# Type Checking Status for Atlas

This document provides information about the current state of type checking in the Atlas project.

## Current Status

The Atlas codebase has been partially annotated with type hints, allowing for static type checking with `mypy`. However, there are still several areas that need improvement.

## Type Checking Setup

A `mypy.ini` configuration file has been added to the project root to configure type checking options. This configuration:

1. Ignores missing stubs for third-party libraries
2. Enables useful warnings without being too strict
3. Configures module-specific options where needed

## Running Type Checking

To run type checking on the Atlas codebase:

```bash
uv tool run mypy .
```

Or to check specific modules:

```bash
uv tool run mypy atlas/agents/base.py
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Missing Type Stubs for External Libraries

Many type errors come from missing type stubs for external libraries like `chromadb`, `anthropic`, and `openai`. The configuration file is set to ignore these errors for now.

Long-term solutions:
- Install type stubs where available: `uv pip install types-requests`
- Create custom stub files for critical libraries without stubs
- Contribute type stubs back to the original projects

### 2. Union Type Handling

Issues with `Optional` and union types (e.g., `str | None`) are common. Pay attention to:
- Properly checking for `None` values before accessing attributes
- Using type guards where appropriate
- Annotating variables properly to avoid inference issues

### 3. Import Order in Examples

The examples directory contains utility scripts with non-standard import orders due to the need to modify `sys.path`. These are marked as errors by linting tools but are necessary for the examples to work correctly.

### 4. Exception Handling

Bare `except:` statements have been replaced with `except Exception as e:` to capture and log the specific error information. This improves error tracing and debugging.

## Recent Improvements

1. Added proper type annotations to key modules:
   - `atlas/agents/base.py`
   - `atlas/knowledge/retrieval.py`
   - `atlas/agents/controller.py`

2. Added `__all__` exports to `atlas/core/__init__.py` to properly handle re-exports

3. Fixed unnecessary imports across multiple modules

4. Added proper exception handling with specific error types

## Priorities for Future Type Improvements

1. Add comprehensive type annotations to remaining core modules
2. Address union type handling in key areas
3. Create or obtain type stubs for critical external dependencies
4. Run type checking as part of CI pipeline
5. Gradually increase mypy strictness level as code quality improves
