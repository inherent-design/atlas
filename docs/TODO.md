## Development Principles

1. **Clean Break Philosophy**: Prioritize building high-quality, robust APIs over maintaining backward compatibility with legacy code.
2. **Parallel Development**: Build new implementations alongside existing code until ready for complete cutover.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Create comprehensive tests alongside or before implementation.
4. **Complete Documentation**: Provide thorough documentation for all new components with clear examples.
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Implement consistent, informative error handling throughout all components.
6. **Type Safety**: Use comprehensive type hints and validation for better code quality and reliability.
7. **Decisive Cutover**: Plan for complete transition to new implementations rather than maintaining dual systems.
